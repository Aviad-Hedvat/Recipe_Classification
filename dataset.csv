1 large egg 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil or small pat of butter sea salt and freshly ground black pepper,1
crack the egg into a small bowl or ramekin heat the olive oil in a nonstick or well-seasoned cast-iron skillet over medium heat and swirl to coat the bottom of the pan carefully pour in the egg and reduce the heat to low cook uncovered for 1 minute then cover and cook until the white are just set 2 to 3 minute for an over easy egg carefully flip the fried egg and cook until the white are fully set about 15 second longer for an over medium or over hard egg transfer to a plate and season to taste with salt and pepper,2
reduce the heat to low and carefully add the egg let it cook for 1 minute then cover the pan and cook for another 2 to 3 minute or until the egg white are set,0
cooking a perfect fried egg is easy…but it’s also easy to mess up a fried egg might stick to the pan it might come out closer to over-hard than over-easy or–worst of all–its yolk might break a you attempt to flip it i’ve made all these mistake over the year while they were disappointing in the moment they paid off in the long run each one taught me a valuable lesson about how to fry an egg and over time i’ve worked out a foolproof fried egg recipe which i’m sharing below,0
how do you like your fried egg sunny side up over easy over medium or over hard,0
this simplest way to serve fried egg is on their own paired with toast breakfast potato andor fresh fruit they’re a classic american breakfast,0

wild rice called manoomin in ojibwe ha significant cultural importance to the indigenous people of the great lake it is part of the anishinaabe creation story and historically it provided essential sustenance throughout the upper midwest’s cold winter indigenous people continue to hand-harvest naturally occurring wild rice around the great lake today knocking the grass with wooden stick so that it release the grain of rice into their canoe if you want to learn more about the rice’s history and cultural significance i recommend reading this article or this one you can purchase hand-harvested rice from native harvest in minnesota here,0
hand-harvested wild rice can be light or dark in color whereas the cultivated kind is always dark brown or black this cooking method will work with either type but note that hand-harvested rice tends to cook more quickly depending on the variety it might be ready in a little a 20 minute whereas the cultivated wild rice you’d find at the grocery store will likely need 50 or more,0
learn how to cook wild rice on the stovetop with it chewy texture and nutty flavor this whole grain is delicious in salad side dish and more,0

start by forming the bottom crust roll out one disc of chilled pie dough on a lightly floured surface find my best tip for rolling out pie dough here transfer the dough to a 9- or 95-inch pie plate and press it firmly into the bottom and up the side tent the crust with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minute roll out the second disc of dough to make the top crust transfer it to a baking sheet and chill it a well,0

what do you look for in an apple pie recipe a few year ago the first time i volunteered to make a homemade apple pie for my family’s thanksgiving i scoured the internet in search of the perfect one i wanted the filling to be juicy but not so juicy that the pie wouldn’t slice i wanted it to be warmly spiced with cinnamon and spiked with lemon for tart bright flavor the best apple pie recipe would yield slice thick enough to stand up to a big scoop of ice cream and it would have a flaky buttery easy-to-make crust,0

hi vera did you change anything about the recipe,0
a you work rotate the dough a quarter turn every few roll unless you’re rolling out the dough on parchment paper rotating it a you roll is essential it help you create a more even circle but more importantly it prevents the dough from sticking irretrievably to your work surface i also like to dust the top of the dough with flour and flip it over a few time a i roll it out,0

finally eat serve the mashed sweet potato hot topped with a sprinkle of fresh parsley or thyme a pat of butter and salt and pepper enjoy,0
if mashed sweet potato have never made an appearance on your dinner table now’s the time to change that they’re just too delicious to not have in your side dish rotation especially in the fall these mashed sweet potato have a beautifully smooth and creamy texture and i season them with garlic ginger and rosemary to create a rich warm flavor that’s part savory part sweet,0
first bake the potato when i make traditional mashed potato i boil the potato in a large pot or cook them in the instant pot but when i’m working with sweet potato i bake them it concentrate their natural sweetness and make their flesh smooth and creamy…perfect for mashed sweet potato wash the potato and poke a few hole in them with a fork place them on a foil-lined baking sheet and bake at 425°f for 60 minute or until tender you should be able to easily pierce them with a fork,0
i notice that the recipe say use 3 pound of sweet potato no matter if i change the serving from 4 to 6 or anywhere in between,0
3 jalapeño pepper 2 left whole 1 sliced in half crosswise 1 garlic clove unpeeled 1½ cup thick whole milk greek yogurt 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon sea salt plus more for sprinkling heaping ¼ teaspoon smoked paprika ½ cup panko breadcrumb 1½ teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil plus more for drizzling ½ cup grated sharp cheddar cheese chopped chive for garnish tortilla chip for serving,1
preheat the oven broiler and line a baking sheet with foil place the 2 whole jalapeños and 1 of the jalapeño half on the baking sheet drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt wrap the garlic clove in a piece of foil with a drizzle of olive oil and place on the baking sheet broil for 10 to 15 minute or until the jalapeños are soft and blistering remove from the oven and set aside to cool when the jalapeños are cool to the touch use your hand wearing glove if desired to peel and remove the loose skin slice the pepper in half and remove the seed and membrane finely chop the pepper remove the garlic from it paper and use the back of a chef’s knife to mash it into a paste in a medium bowl stir together the yogurt onion powder salt smoked paprika garlic and roasted jalapeños in a small bowl toss the panko with the olive oil transfer the yogurt mixture to a small skillet or baking dish top with the cheese and sprinkle with the panko broil for 1 to 5 minute or until the topping is golden brown the timing will depend on your broiler remove from the oven thinly slice the remaining jalapeño half and sprinkle the slice over the dip top with chive and serve with tortilla chip,2
3 adding the topping and broiling the dip quickly prep the panko by tossing it with a little olive oil,0
a typical jalapeño popper dip recipe would call for cream cheese mayonnaise andor sour cream to create the creamy base but in my recipe i shake thing up a bit and use greek yogurt it give the dip a smooth creamy texture and rich tangy flavor while packing in lot of protein make sure to use a brand with a really thick consistency such a fage or chobani,0
this jalapeño popper dip is what you’d get if you flipped regular jalapeño popper inside out instead of stuffing a creamy cheesy mixture into the jalapeños you chop up the jalapeños and stir them into a creamy cheesy dip i’m warning you now it is insanely delicious this jalapeño popper dip delivers all the rich smoky tangy spicy flavor you look for in a classic jalapeño popper and you get to scoop it up with tortilla chip which add amazing salty crunch make it for your next party or game day get-together and it will be gone in minute,0
hi nicole i’m glad you enjoyed the dip we haven’t had that issue with the temperature it must be a difference between oven we haven’t tried this but you could bake it for a few minute at 350 before broiling to heat the dip through,0
2 mixing up the dip place the chopped roasted pepper and roasted garlic in a medium bowl with the yogurt onion powder smoked paprika and salt stir to combine,0
⅔ cup all-purpose flour spooned and leveled ¼ cup cornstarch 1 teaspoon garlic powder 1 teaspoon onion powder 1 teaspoon paprika ½ teaspoon sea salt ¾ cup water 1 head cauliflower about 2 pound broken into large floret buffalo sauce for brushing vegan ranch for dipping optional,1

this recipe turned out great and had just the right amount of heat i used your buffalo sauce and dipped the cauliflower wing in your vegan ranch dressing recipe they didn’t turn out a crispy a i’d thought but they tasted delicious i will make these again for company i’d post a photo on instagram but i don’t really use instagram much,0

3 simmer the sofritas on the stove heat the avocado oil in a large skillet over medium heat add the sauce and crispy tofu and use a wooden spoon to combine stir 14 cup water into the pan then cook stirring until the sauce thickens 7 to 10 minute,0
the obvious move is to add the sofritas to a burrito bowl serve them over a bed of rice or cilantro lime rice with a squeeze of fresh lime juice and whatever fixing you like you can’t go wrong with any of these,0
i’m so glad you loved the recipe,0
1 roast the veggie and tofu the pepper tomato onion and garlic become soft and caramelized in the oven which add so much flavor to the sofritas sauce torn into big crumbles the tofu becomes firm and crisp around the edge which help it stand up to the thick sauce later on,0
i’m so glad it wa a hit,0

when i’m craving enchilada on a weeknight i first make this red enchilada sauce recipe it’s the perfect starting point for fast flavorful homemade enchilada it take minute to make and it call for simple pantry ingredient still it balance of tangy earthy and savory flavor really pack a punch swap it in for the store-bought stuff and i promise you’ll taste the difference,0
growing up in the midwest i thought of enchilada sauce a one thing the tomato-based stuff that come in a can but when i moved to austin i learned that in mexican and tex mex cooking enchilada sauce doesn’t always look one way it can have a base of zingy tomatillo or be a chili gravy made from broth and spice or it can be a mole or a piquant blend of rehydrated dried chile all that’s to say that this recipe is just one type of enchilada sauce basically an upgraded version of the canned kind though i love experimenting with other style of enchilada sauce a well i often come back to this one because it’s so easy to prepare,0

other topping that would be great here pickled red onion and pickled jalapeños would both be excellent you could also sub a slice of cheddar cheese for the goat cheese or fill the sandwich with sautéed green and a soft scramble or fried egg instead of the omelet but probably stick to the omelet if you want to meal prep this recipe,0
½ banana mashed 1 teaspoon cocoa powder ¼ teaspoon cinnamon pinch nutmeg banana slice chopped walnut chocolate chip,1
make the base recipe in a mason jar or other lidded jar place the oat chia seed maple syrup salt and greek yogurt if using add the almond milk and stir until the mixture is well combined and there are no clump of chia seed at the bottom of the jar cover and refrigerate overnight or for up to 5 day in the morning top with your desired topping and serve with drizzle of maple syrup for apple pie overnight oat stir the applesauce and cinnamon into the overnight oat base refrigerate overnight in the morning top with diced apple chopped pecan and cinnamon apple and drizzle of maple syrup if desired for peach crisp overnight oat make the plain overnight oat base refrigerate overnight in the morning top with peach slice granola and drizzle of maple syrup if desired for pb&j overnight oat make the plain overnight oat base refrigerate overnight in the morning top with chia jam peanut butter chopped strawberry raspberry and chopped peanut for chocolate banana bread overnight oat stir the mashed banana cocoa powder cinnamon and nutmeg into the overnight oat base refrigerate overnight in the morning top with banana slice chopped walnut chocolate chip and drizzle of maple syrup if desired,2
i recommend waiting to add any topping until the morning you plan to eat your oat that way nut seed and granola will stay crunchy and fruit will stay bright and fresh,0
when someone asks me for an easy healthy breakfast idea this overnight oat recipe is the first thing i suggest it’s perfect for busy morning a you can make individual serving ahead of time and take them on the go it’s also satisfying enough to keep you full till lunch made with simple ingredient like oat chia seed and optional yogurt but best of all it’s fun,0
if you’re meal prepping overnight oat set out a mason jar for each serving you want to prep add all the ingredient except the milk to each jar then add the milk to one jar and stir that jar together before adding the milk to the next i find that adding the milk to one jar at a time help prevent the chia seed from getting too clumpy once you mix up all the overnight oat cover and refrigerate until you’re ready to eat,0
this week i made the pb&j version using the chia strawberry jam it is now my favorite,0
when you’re ready to eat give the oat another stir add your desired topping and enjoy,0

these punchy bowl are a fun refreshing summer dinner the sweet zesty peach salsa play off avocado grilled halloumi and fragrant coconut rice,0
6 to 8 ounce halloumi cheese extra-virgin olive oil,1
preheat a grill or grill pan to high heat slice the halloumi into ½-inch-thick plank rub both side with olive oil and place on the hot grill reduce the heat to medium and grill for 2 to 3 minute per side or until well-charred,2
i wonder this seems a though it might be similar to a cheese that is popular here in wisconsin – juusto cheese perhaps it’s popular because we have a dairy that produce it and that’s how i discovered it juusto is a finnish cheese maybe not similar thanks for this recipe i will keep my eye out for this here in the midwest,0

if panzanella is my favorite summer dinner then grilled halloumi cheese is unquestionably jack’s he doesn’t care how i serve it in a summery grain bowl in sandwich or just plated up with sliced tomato and a side of crusty bread he love it charred salty flavor and rich squeaky texture i can’t blame him – i’m a big fan of it too,0

let me tell you why i love it compared to it more assertive cousin say balsamic or white wine vinegar champagne vinegar ha a quieter more delicate flavor a a result this champagne vinaigrette is ideal for drizzling over the tender lettuce herb and other green that are in season at this time of year it give them pep and zing but it doesn’t overwhelm their natural sweet earthy and herbaceous flavor so if you find yourself tossing together a side salad in the next couple of week remember this champagne vinaigrette would be the perfect way to dress it up,0
this champagne vinaigrette will elevate all sort of salad toss it with a simple green salad or try using it in place of the salad dressing in any of these recipe,0

when the float valve drop remove the lid fluff the rice with a fork and enjoy,0
after you rinse the rice place it in the instant pot pour in 2 12 cup of water for every 2 cup of rice you might notice that this ratio of water to rice is lower than what you’d use if you were cooking the rice on the stove that’s because much le water evaporates from the instant pot so you don’t need a much to cook fluffy tender rice,0
if there’s one recipe that made me an instant pot convert it wa this instant pot brown rice let’s be honest cooking brown rice on the stove is no one’s favorite thing to do it requires 40 minute of hovering nearby nudging the heat up and down to keep the pot at a lively simmer but this instant pot brown rice recipe is almost entirely hands-off once you get it going you can focus on making the rest of your meal without giving the rice a second thought knowing that it’ll come out fluffy tender and perfectly cooked try it once and you’ll never cook brown rice any other way,0

another great thing about this fruit tart recipe is that it doesn’t require any baking i love a good peach cobbler or peach crisp but when it’s hot outside i can’t always justify turning on the oven to make one this easy fruit tart is the perfect substitute the crust set up in the freezer the filling set up in the fridge the only downside is that you’ll need some patience to resist stealing a piece before it’s fully set,0
can you use regular cream cheese instead of vegan and get the same result,0

holy moly amazing i added extra chipotle three to be exact maybe mine were very mild not spicy but delish also all the honey i added got stuck at the bottom of the blender and i had to mix it in when i poured out the sauce so just beware of your honey getting lost in the bottom definitely make this though it’s amazing i poured it over roasted sweet potato with black bean and topped with cilantro pickled onion could have been a nice addition…,0

looking for a sub for coconut oil in this recipe i love everything you do thank you for the healthy delicious food,0
not sure if your son can have other nut but another nut butter could work you could play with something like applesauce but you’d have to alter the recipe considerably with the extra moisture i’d try to stick to another nut or sunflower seed butter or soy butter also i had to sub the almond flour with wheat flour and it came out nicely,0
would love to make these ala my husband is allergic to nut and coconut can you offer any substitution we do use sunflower seed oil and butter do you think that would work i wa also wondering if banana could work i do love your recipe,0

1 ripe avocado peeled pitted and roughly chopped 1 large handful fresh cilantro finely chopped 3 tablespoon fresh lime juice 3 tablespoon mayonnaise ½ teaspoon kosher salt,1

the recipe come from julia turshen’s new cookbook simply julia which is packed with 110 recipe for healthy comfort food like this avocado sauce recipe and these cauliflower taco each one is simple to make but filled with flavor they’re not all vegetarian but there’s an entire section of vegan entrées and one of vegetable side dish with many more meat-free and gluten-free dish scattered throughout the book,0
taste the sauce and add more salt if needed then enjoy it right away or store it in an airtight container in the fridge for up to a day,0
no food processor no problem add the ingredient to a medium bowl and mash them together with a fork or potato masher the sauce won’t be a smooth but it’ll still taste great,0

3 tablespoon melted butter ½ to 1 teaspoon sea salt ⅓ cup nutritional yeast flake optional,1
in a large pot with a lid heat the oil over medium heat add a few of the corn kernel a soon a they start to pop add the rest of the kernel and remove the pot from the heat for 30 second so that all the kernel gently come to the same temperature put the pot back on the heat with the lid on but just partially off center venting so that some of the steam can escape too much steam can make the popcorn soggy shake the pan a the popcorn pop so that it doesnt burn on the bottom once the popping slows down transfer the popcorn to a large bowl drizzle the butter over the popcorn sprinkle with salt and toss add the nutritional yeast flake if desired,2
to make popcorn on the stove you’ll start with 2 basic ingredient,0
head up – this stuff is seriously addictive salty crunchy and tossed with a savory sprinkle of nutritional yeast it’ll ruin you for bagged popcorn forever it’s crispier it’s more flavorful and it’s so simple to make that buying pre-popped popcorn is hardly easier seriously you’re just 5 ingredient and 15 minute away from a delectable salty snack,0
i’ve been making stovetop popcorn all my life for subtle textural and kernel size difference i blend 3 different type of seed – yellow red and white for topping i use butter bud dehydrated butter and unflavored popcorn salt i apply both immediately after pouring into the bowl so they adhere better to the popped corn,0

hi – it look a if nobody ha answered you hope i can help you can buy a set of measuring cup in britain – my daughter bought me one after i kept complaining about american recipe but i have a chart i found online which tell me that 14 of a cup is 4 tablespoon or 60 ml if that’s easier the recipe is for 4 people so if you are just cooking for yourself you would need 1 tablespoon each of yoghurt and mayonnaise and just under a teaspoon of lemon juice plus a little garlic and onion powder and almost a teaspoon of dill if you are cooking for 2 you’d need 2 tablespoon each of yoghurt and mayonnaise and a bit le than 2 teaspoon of lemon juice a little garlic and onion powder and nearly 2 teaspoon of dill maybe i’m telling you stuff you don’t need me to tell you but i hope that some of it help and that you enjoy don’t know about you but i would crush the garlic if you can – grating is a pain,0

omg this dressing is sooooooo good my son who hate salad ate a whole plate of salad with this dressing and ha declared that he love salad now wondering if this can be freezed and used at a later time,0
my favorite way to use this avocado dressing is on salad i love that it’s rich and creamy but that it’s not made with sour cream mayo or yogurt like many creamy dressing are you’ll find it in this asparagus salad recipe but it’d be lovely on my bright spring salad or simple green salad too,0
i made this recipe exactly per the direction personally i think it ha too much lemon juice all i can taste is lemon juice i wa so looking forward to having this on my salad and now it doesn’t taste good i will try this recipe again but of course without the lemon juice,0

1 globe artichoke 1 lemon quartered artichoke dipping sauce for serving,1
prepare the artichoke stem pull any leaf off the stem and use a vegetable peeler to peel off the stem woody exterior use a sharp stainless steel knife to trim off the end of the stem and gently score the trimmed end with an x pattern rub the stem all over with the cut side of one of the lemon segment to prevent browning prepare the artichoke bud cut off the top quarter off the artichoke about 12-1 inch rub the cut leaf all over with the lemon use kitchen shear to snip off the pointy tip of the remaining leaf steam the artichoke fill a large pot with 1 inch of water and squeeze in any remaining lemon juice add the squeezed lemon segment to the pot place a steamer basket in the pot add the artichoke and bring to a boil cover and steam for 35-45 minute or until the artichoke stem is fork-tender and you can easily peel off the outer leaf remove the choke allow the artichoke to cool slightly slice it in half lengthwise and use a small spoon to scoop out the hairy choke serve the artichoke half with melted butter or another dipping sauce of your choice to eat dip the leaf into the sauce and use your teeth to scrape off the meat discarding the tough fibrous shell you can eat the artichoke heart and stem in their entirety,2
enjoyed,0
unless you’re working with baby artichoke there’s one more step before you eat you need to remove the choke in baby artichoke the choke is edible to do this slice the steamed artichoke in half lengthwise use a small spoon to scoop out the hairy choke which sits between the cup-shaped artichoke heart and the tender inner leaf,0
for a dip i mix mayo fresh dill lemon juice garlic powdersaltpepper,0
first make sure you have the right equipment artichoke start to brown a soon a you cut them to reduce this oxidation you’ll need a quartered lemon to rub on the cut surface of the artichoke i also recommend using a stainless steel knife instead of a carbon-steel one which can increase browning in addition you’ll need a cutting board a peeler a large pot and a steamer basket,0

this potato leek soup recipe is super simple to make here’s how it go,0
hi lily i’m glad you enjoyed the soup i think the immersion blender v a regular standing blender might have caused the texture difference i haven’t tried this one with an immersion blender,0
good and easy i had to use 6 cup of broth and actually probably closer to 7 to get the proper soup consistency otherwise it would be more like a thin puréedmashed potato than a soup and i followed the recipe precisely before adding the extra liquid i just don’t see how 4 cup can possibly thin out all the potato and bean starch it wa a bit of a chore for my immersion blender but it got the job done,0
that’s it,0

i’m ready to make these but i don’t happen to have almond butter would peanut butter work in it place thanks,0
but i didn’t find the recipe for chocolate,0

4 carrot peeled,1
place a box grater on a cutting board pick up a carrot by it thick end and run it tip down the large hole of the grater continue this downward shredding motion until about 2 inch of the carrot remain intact stop here to avoid cutting your finger on the hole of the box grater repeat with the remaining carrot,2
shredded carrot are a wonderful addition to sweet and savory recipe i often toss them into salad for extra color and crunch and they’re also delicious in these curried millet and carrot cake otherwise i love to use them in carrot cake-inspired treat try them in any of these recipe,0
taste aside you could argue that buying shredded carrot save time but if it doe it doesn’t save much this method for how to shred carrot by hand is quick and easy and it only requires one piece of basic equipment a box grater try it once and you’ll never buy grated carrot at the store again,0
i find it useful but if you can’t find carrot with green attached don’t worry any large carrot will work here,0
comment,0
this method will work for any quantity of carrot but i use it most when i’m just shredding 1-4 if i need a larger quantity of grated carrot i use the shredding disk on my food processor to save time,0

head up making this vegan brownie recipe is not like making traditional brownie while the result are pretty darn similar – fudgy rich and delicious – the batter is totally different if you think something’s gone wrong while you’re making the recipe don’t freak out it probably hasn’t here’s how the process should go,0
these vegan brownie will satisfy any chocolate craving theyre fudgy decadent and rich - youd never guess theyre made without egg or butter,0
hi amy others have done it in the comment but i haven’t tried it myself the pan size is a little more than 2x so the brownie will be a little thinner in the pan so you should watch them and bake them a tad le hope that help,0
by contrast these vegan brownie are sweet and decadent they’re the sort of thing you make when a serious chocolate craving strike or when a special occasion say valentine’s day… is right around the corner i think you’re going to love them,0
it will be thick instead of making a pourable batter you’ll end up with a fudgy dough it will be crumbly but hold together when pinched,0

my method for how to cook black bean from scratch is slightly different from my approach to cooking other type of bean because i often use them in black bean recipe like taco and enchilada i want them to hold their shape a a result i don’t soak the bean before i cook them i also find that not soaking creates a richer creamier cooking liquid which make the bean an especially delicious side dish so i skip the soak and follow these easy step,0

2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 4 medium yellow onion halved and sliced ½ teaspoon sea salt,1
heat the oil in a 12-inch cast iron skillet over medium heat add the onion and sauté for 5 minute or until starting to soften add the salt reduce the heat to medium low and cook for 50 to 80 minute stirring every few minute or until the onion are very soft golden brown and caramelized the timing will depend on the size of your onion and the heat of your stove if at any point the onion start to stick to the bottom of the pan reduce the heat to low if the onion aren’t deeply brown after 50 minute and you’d like to speed thing up you can turn the heat higher to get more caramelization stir continuously to prevent burning,2
i hate onion raw but i love vidalia onion cooked and i love caramelized onion i took a shot at this and omg great i didn’t have a cast iron pan used one of my big non-stick skillet perfect thanks,0
once all the onion have softened reduce the heat to medium-low and continue to cook stirring every few minute if the onion start to burn or stick to the bottom of the pan reduce the heat to low you could also add a splash of water if the pan start to dry out,0
these lovely caramelized onion also go extremely well with chicken liver paté and toasted bread just a suggestion,0

hi megan i’m so glad you enjoyed it i’m a freak for herb too 🙂 i’m so glad you loved it with the pear salad ha 🙂,0
in many of my stuffed acorn squash recipe i use quinoa to make the filling but here i go in a different direction instead of using a grain i make the filling with crumbled tempeh and mushroom they create a hearty texture and savory flavor that contrast perfectly with the sweet creamy squash for extra texture and depth of flavor i round out the filling with these key ingredient,0
i’ve shared a number of stuffed acorn squash recipe over the year you can even find one in love & lemon every day though i’d have a tough time choosing a favorite this one’s certainly up there i season the tempeh and mushroom filling with sage and rosemary so it aromatic savory flavor scream thanksgiving topped with a sprinkle of pomegranate seed it’s a perfect centerpiece for a fall feast,0
ooops i meant to say base layer,0
1 pomegranate large bowl of water,1
use a sharp knife to cut the top of the pomegranate about 14 inch score the side of the pomegranate holding the fruit you might notice that there are 5-6 gentle ridge in it surface use your knife to make thin slit along those ridge you should be cutting along the fruit white pith not slicing open any of the aril after you make the cut use your hand to peel the fruit open and gently divide it into segment fill a large bowl with water submerge the segment and use your hand to remove the seed from the skin and membrane the seed will sink to the bottom of the bowl while the white spongy membrane will float to the top skim off the white bit and drain the seed,2
who else love pomegranate a soon a these vibrant ruby red fruit appear at the grocery store each fall jack and i start eating them like crazy we can’t get enough of their sweettart flavor and their juicy bursty texture i sprinkle the seed over dessert salad and even dip while jack eats them by the spoonful a a snack,0

4 cup fresh cranberry ½ cup maple syrup ¼ cup water 1 teaspoon orange zest pinch of salt,1
in a medium saucepan over medium-low heat combine the cranberry maple syrup water orange zest and salt bring to a simmer stirring often so that the maple syrup doesn’t burn reduce the heat to low and cook stirring frequently until the cranberry burst and the sauce ha thickened 15 to 20 minute taste and adjust the seasoning if desired and serve,2
i actually make this whenever i run out in other word i always have some “extra sour cranberry sauce” in the fridge–mostly for toast 🙂 i love the tartness and the texture the next batch i will make with maple syrup that’s a cool idea my last batch had gran marnier in it that went well with the orange zest,0
aww i’m so glad you’ve been loving our thanksgiving recipe i hope you enjoy the cranberry sauce,0

1 bunch leek extra-virgin olive oil a needed sea salt and freshly ground black pepper,1
to sauté follow the cutting method described above and warm a glug of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat add the leek a few pinch of salt and pepper and cook stirring occasionally until they soften about 5 minute to roast chop into 1-inch chunk and wash them using the method described above toss with olive oil salt and pepper and roast at 425° for 15 to 20 minute or until theyre tender to grill slice in half lengthwise skip the chopping step above rinse and dry them well drizzle with a little olive oil and grill both side on medium-high until theyre well-charred and tender season with salt and pepper,2
i usually saute them in oil or butter a few minute they tend to stick to the bottom of the pan so i always add a bit of water a i go when they’re cooked shouldn’t take long i add light cream salt and pepper and i leave it just enough for the cream to heat up i serve it over white rice and pan-fried salmon i strongly recommend it it’s divine,0
what are your favorite leek recipe let me know in the comment,0
ever heard of potato leek soup i thought so but how often do you cook leek in other recipe have you tried them in pasta stuffing or risotto have you eaten them on their own if i had my way we’d all be eating leek way more often they’re incredibly versatile adding unique sweet and mild onion flavor to a huge range of dish,0

preheat the oven to 350°f trim the top ¼ inch off the top of the garlic bulb place the garlic cut-side up on a piece of foil drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt tip i like to use a small baking dish or ramekin to help the garlic sit cut-side up wrap the garlic in the foil and roast for 40 to 60 minute or until the clove are deeply golden brown and tender use in any recipe like mashed potato or cauliflower mashed potato that call for roasted garlic it also freeze well,2

hi pamela i’m so glad you loved the recipe using stock instead of water is a great idea,0
it’s actually just a large stainless steel pan it’s the open kitchen line at williams sonoma,0
could i use minced garlic in place of sliced if so how much,0
when i make sautéed broccoli i often enjoy it a a side dish it’s light and refreshing with a nice crisp-tender bite it pair well with almost everything so serve it with whatever protein pasta or soup you like the lemon and garlic in this recipe give the sautéed broccoli a bright fresh flavor but if you want to punch it up more drizzle on some vegan ranch tahini dressing or lemon vinaigrette some everything bagel seasoning or grated parmesan cheese would be a yummy topping too,0

the resulting soup is totally vegan but thanks to the blended veggie it’s still creamy and comforting the roasted tomato give it a rich umami flavor and the basil add a lovely fresh finish if you can make a double batch eat half hot off the stove with a gooey grilled cheese sandwich or hunk of crusty bread then freeze the rest to enjoy on a fall or winter night when you’re longing for a taste of summer,0
first roast the tomato slice them in half vertically and arrange them cut-side-up on a parchment-lined baking sheet drizzle them with olive oil and season them with salt and pepper then roast them at 350° for an hour until they’re still juicy but starting to shrivel,0

stuffed pepper are among the handful of dish that will always remind me of being a kid growing up they were a fixture in my mom’s regular recipe rotation right alongside creamy broccoli soup eggplant parmesan and mac and cheese back then i’d eat the filling made from ground beef italian seasoning tomato sauce and rice and push aside the pepper in hindsight it’s not hard to see why people were surprised when i became a vegetarian 🙂,0
these were really good and an easy week night dinner i made a couple change based on what i had available and considering spice factor for my kid and it still turned out great,0
meanwhile make the filling combine the lime juice and zest spice scallion cilantro jalapeño salt and olive oil at the bottom of a large bowl fold in the rice black bean and corn and season to taste with salt and pepper,0
this might be my new favorite food it wa phenomenal i left the fresh jalapeños out for my two- and four-year-olds but loaded up the adult plate with some pickled jalapeños i’ll be thinking about this until i make it again… soon,0
this look so tempting i will definitely try this recipe thanks for sharing,0

to salt or not to salt that is the question if you eat eggplant often you probably know that many recipe advise you to salt and drain eggplant for at least 20 minute and up to a few hour before cooking it salting is said to improve the eggplant’s bitter flavor and spongy texture my two cent it isn’t necessary here skipping this step will save you lot of time and your grilled eggplant will still taste great provided you sprinkle it with salt before you eat,0

who else love yellow squash like zucchini it start to take over my fridge at this point in the summer but i really can’t complain this tender sunny summer squash is versatile nourishing and super easy to cook i love to grill it roast it and even eat it raw but lately i’ve been hooked on this sautéed yellow squash recipe,0

preheat a grill to medium high heat in a medium bowl combine the corn onion red pepper garlic salt and the tabasco green sauce chill until ready to use spray the grill grate with cooking spray and grill the watermelon 2 to 3 minute per side or until char mark form remove and let cool a few minute then top with the corn mixture the feta avocado and fresh herb serve with more tabasco or lime wedge on the side if desired,2
see i love summer fruit like berry cherry peach and watermelon but unlike jack who’s happy to eat an entire pint of blueberry in a single sitting i rarely eat fruit on it own more often i use it a a sweet accent in savory dish like these summer roll or this strawberry salad so for me grilling watermelon only make it better it sweetness becomes more concentrated but it take on a charred smoky flavor a well you could eat it on it own but it’s even better with a tangy spicy mix of fresh corn feta avocado and herb on top,0

¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil 2 garlic clove smashed or halved 8 thick slice country bread about 4 cup cubed sea salt dried parsley or desired seasoning,1
preheat the oven to 350°f and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper in a small saucepan gently heat the olive oil and smashed garlic until aromatic about 1 minute remove from the heat cut the bread into cube and place them on the baking sheet remove the garlic from the saucepan and drizzle the garlic oil over the bread sprinkle with sea salt toss to coat and spread the bread in a single layer on the baking sheet bake for 10 to 18 minute or until golden brown and crisp the timing will depend on your bread and how crispy you like your crouton sprinkle with dried parsley for grilled crouton drizzle whole bread slice with olive oil and grill until lightly charred use the cut-side of a halved piece of garlic to rub garlic onto the hot bread slice the grilled bread into cube,2
this method for how to make crouton is super easy it take under 30 minute and most of that is hands-off baking time if i’m making crouton for a specific soup or salad i like to pop them in the oven first and prep the rest of the meal while they bake here’s how i make them,0
first cube the bread you want good-quality country or french bread for this recipe but don’t worry about it being super fresh day-old or days-old bread is fine – the goal is to get it nice and crispy so leftover bread ha a head start cut it into 34-inch cube try to get them a even a you can so that they cook at the same rate in the oven,0
luckily homemade crouton are incredibly easy to make all you need is good crusty bread tip the better the bread the better the crouton garlic olive oil plenty of salt and a little dried parsley yep this crouton recipe is that simple and the result are fantastic the homemade crouton are crunchy rich and garlicky – far better than any you’d find at the grocery store once you learn how to make crouton at home you won’t look back,0
next toss toss to coat the bread with the oil and a few big pinch of salt when everything is evenly coated in the oil and salt spread the bread cube in a single layer on a baking sheet,0

i make caper every year by pickling the tiny unopened bud from red bud tree they have a nice bite and are packed with vitamin c,0
jack and i have loved eating caper berry on our trip to italy but at home i most often cook with the smaller more tender bud if i have caper berry on hand i might add them to an appetizer board or toss them into certain salad but for most of my caper recipe the bud are the way to go,0

instead my recipe is a riff on osaka or kansai-style okonomiyaki in this style the ingredient are all mixed together typically they include cabbage green onion and some combination of meat and seafood like pork belly octopus squid or shrimp of course my recipe is vegetarian so you won’t find any meat or seafood here,0
this ha become a staple in my house so thank you so much for turning me on to it i sometimes add grated daikon radish korean mu if i have a lot and keep the recipe simple i use flour rather than panko and they hold together well while cooking my latest food crush ha me adding spicy chili crisp to the batter along with a dash of soy sauce and a dash of black vinegar you can mix up the topping with anything from nothing to a thin drizzle of teriyaki sauce to the worcester sauce included here they’re all good and one of my favorite way to add more cabbage to my diet google give hundred of variation of okonomiyaki i’m going to try chopping some kimchi into it next,0

2 cup whole rolled oat 12 cup chopped walnut or almond or a mix of both 12 cup coconut flake optional 2 teaspoon cinnamon 12 teaspoon sea salt 2 tablespoon melted coconut oil 14 cup maple syrup 2 tablespoon creamy almond butter 13 cup dried cranberry optional,1
preheat the oven to 300°f and line a baking sheet with parchment paper in a medium bowl combine the oat walnut coconut flake if using cinnamon and salt drizzle in the coconut oil and maple syrup and add the almond butter stir until combined scoop the granola onto the baking sheet and press the mixture into a 1-inch-thick oval this will encourage clumping bake for 15 minute rotate the pan halfway and use a fork to gently break the granola apart just a bit bake for 15 minute more or until golden brown sprinkle with dried cranberry if desired let cool for 15 minute before serving,2
update i just lightly greased my sheet pan with canola oil worked just fine also… this granola came out scrumptious way better than store-bought i added coconut flake pumpkin seed dried cranberry raisin slivered almond and chocolate morsel,0
there a lot to love about this homemade granola recipe it easy to make it healthy it delicious and it will make your kitchen smell amazing,0
store your granola in an airtight container at room temperature for up to a week enjoy it on it own a a snack add it to a yogurt parfait or eat it like cereal with a splash of milk i love granola with my homemade maple vanilla oat milk,0
hi barbara i think that would work fine the texture might be a bit different and i’d start checking the granola a few minute earlier a whole rolled oat are thicker than quick-cooking one,0
let me know what variation you try,0
12 cup whole rolled oat 3 cup water 2 teaspoon maple syrup ½ teaspoon vanilla extract ⅛ teaspoon sea salt,1
combine the oat water maple syrup vanilla and salt in a blender and blend for 30 second place a fine mesh strainer over a large bowl and strain the milk without pushing any excess pulp through the strainer this will create a creamier texture that’s not gritty or gummy add more maple syrup to taste if desired chill overnight if you want to drink your oat milk right away i recommend adding ice - it flavor is best when well chilled,2
next try these plant based basic tofu tempeh quinoa chickpea or lentil,0
making delicious oat milk is easy but if you have made other plant-based milk in the past a word to the wise it is not like making almond milk where you wring a much liquid a you can out of a nut milk bag in this recipe your goal is to squeeze and press the mixture a little a possible otherwise it will end up slimy and grainy here’s my method,0

unlike other non-dairy milk recipe this one doesn’t require any special equipment looking at you nut milk bag and because you don’t need to soak the oat beforehand it take minute to make all you need is 5 minute a handful of whole rolled oat filtered water a fine mesh strainer and a powerful blender what are you waiting for,0

hi kristen i love coconut milk the best – homemade cashew cream could work if it wa blended to the right consistency not super thick store bought nut milk would be too thin here unless it’s simmered down longer to thicken yogurt could work but would require a different cook time so that it won’t curdle in short i think either would work but wouldn’t be a 11 swap without adjusting some of the method i hope that help,0
i’m so glad you loved it,0

if you love this peanut butter cookie recipe try any of these favorite cookie recipe next,0
hi lys wa your peanut butter very smooth and not dry or chunky,0
looked through the comment but didn’t see if anyone asked this – apology in advance if it’s a repeat q if i use unsalted peanut butter should i increase the salt in the recipe,0
then whisk together the wet ingredient and the dry ingredient in separate bowl fold the dry ingredient into the wet ingredient and stir until everything is well combined the dough will be very thick,0
dough did not come out right they taste gr8 after fixing and using a little vegan butter 😉,0
14 ounce extra-firm tofu patted dry and cubed ½ tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 2 tablespoon tamari ½ teaspoon sriracha 1 tablespoon cornstarch optional,1
preheat the oven to 425°f and line a baking sheet with parchment paper toss the cubed tofu with the olive oil tamari and sriracha for extra crispy tofu sprinkle with the cornstarch and gently toss to coat spread the tofu evenly onto the baking sheet bake 20 to 25 minute or until browned around the edge remove and serve warm,2
tofu can get a bad rap a a meat substitute but it’s actually an incredibly versatile ingredient when blended it ha a great creamy texture – you can use it in a vegan mousse or pudding and it’s essential for making a creamy ricotta substitute in my lasagna and vegan stuffed shell most often i bake it to add protein and hearty texture to bowl noodle and salad,0
excellent for first time tofu virgind,0
i’ve used the whole food brand west soy the trader joes brand and a brand that’s local to my area,0
finally bake transfer the baking sheet to a 425°f oven and cook until the cube are browned around the edge enjoy,0
tofu is a soy-based food that’s made from curdling soy milk and forming it into a solid block it’s a good source of plant-based protein that can be used in all sort of way it’s a great addition to vegetarian and vegan diet but even if you’re a meat eater i urge you to try it in my tofu recipe i don’t use it a a meat substitute but rather a something unique and delicious in it own right,0

followed to the letter and it wa really bland wasn’t awful but definitely worth the effort or the cost of having the oven at 425 it need a lot more flavor – some herbsspices anything,0
discard the seed and dice the remaining squash into 1-inch cube you might get some funky shape around the base of the squash where the seed were scooped out just do the best you can to cut the piece evenly – the closer they are in size the more evenly they’ll cook,0
thanks for the guidance our squash is on the parchment paper a i type and just about to go into the oven,0

while i love my slow roasted tomato this recipe is kind of the opposite – the cherry tomato roast fast which mean that you can put together this simple appetizer in no time it’s closely based on the charred cherry tomato recipe from the book ottolenghi simple a book i’ve enjoyed all summer long for quick & easy recipe that use minimal ingredient,0
with lemon olive oil sea salt & parmesan with marinara sauce with pesto with roasted tomato with grilled or roasted veggie,1
choose the type of noodle you would like to make and follow the instruction for each option below for curly spaghetti noodle using a countertop spiralizer clamp the spiralizer to your countertop trim off the tip of the zucchini and secure it between the blade and the teeth of the spiralizer turn the handle to make the noodle for straight angel hair noodle using a julienne peeler simply hold the zucchini with one hand and pull the julienne peeler across the zucchini to make strip for fettucine noodle using a mandoline and a knife slice thin zucchini plank with the mandoline and then cut those plank into fettuccine-sized strip for pappardelle noodle using a regular vegetable peeler use the peeler to simply peel thin strip of zucchini serve the zucchini noodle raw with a warm sauce the heat of the sauce will gently cook the noodle without making them mushy or heat a skillet to medium heat brush with olive oil add the noodle and heat 1 minute or until just warmed through remove and serve with desired sauce and topping,2
i add them to soup salad & pasta salad and even layer them into lasagna they may seem intimidating to make at home but with the right tool spoiler alert a spiralizer isn’t always necessary it’s easy plus making your own zucchini noodle is cheaper than buying them at the store and it’s fun to transform a vegetable into your favorite pasta shape so grab a bunch of zucchini and let’s get started,0
hi dawn i’m so glad you loved it,0
with marinara sauce,0
julienned noodle are thinner and straighter than spiralized noodle but they taste just the same i love this option because julienne peeler are tiny so they’ll fit in any drawer they’re also cheap i tested out three type so that i could recommend the best one for you this one this one and this one they all worked perfectly so my choice is this oxo good grip one because it’s just 7,0

with their concentrated umami flavor roasted tomato are an excellent addition to pasta salad soup tomato sauce and more here are some of my favorite way to use them,0
luckily making oven-roasted tomato couldn’t be easier all you need is olive oil salt and tomato when you’re choosing tomato variety choose small to medium-sized one i especially like to roast cherry tomato but grape tomato or plum tomato work too the hardest part is waiting for them to cook here’s how to roast them,0
i’m so glad you loved them,0
make sure you roast a big batch – you’ll find endless way to use them around here we can’t get enough of them on pizza in pasta or on their own straight out of the oven,0

i’ve posted a few caprese salad recipe over the year if you look through the recipe index you’ll find one with strawberry one with plum one with a drizzle of mint pesto and even cute little caprese skewer with peach what you won’t find though is this a classic caprese salad with soft creamy fresh mozzarella juicy seasonal tomato and a generous amount of basil leaf it’s a salad that’s been near and dear to my heart ever since we visited the island of capri year ago just after jack proposed it wa a magical trip where we ate caprese salad every day while questioning how a dish with such simple ingredient could possibly taste so amazing this is a recipe that you hardly need a recipe for but keep reading for my tip to make the best caprese salad along with a few more fun variation,0
i am a big fan of your cooking it’s so colorful and so good thank you,0
in addition to peak-season tomato you need these 5 simple ingredient,0

preheat a grill to high heat toss the zucchini lightly with olive oil and pinch of salt and pepper grill cut side-down for 2 minute then flip and grill skin-side down for 3 to 4 minute or until char mark form remove from the grill transfer to a plate and squeeze with lemon juice in a small bowl mix together the yogurt lemon zest garlic and ¼ teaspoon salt spread the yogurt on a medium serving platter top with the zucchini feta mint and red pepper flake season to taste and serve,2
while a lot of grilled zucchini recipe call for slicing the squash into thin slab i like to cut it into wedge this way the zucchini keep a nice bite a it cook lightly charred and tender these perfectly grilled zucchini wedge are great on their own so you can stop there if you want however i highly recommend that you take them one step further by serving them with lemony greek yogurt fresh herb and feta this preparation is so easy to toss together and it transforms the plain grilled zucchini into a bright and simple yet elevated side dish,0
timely post for those of u stuck with an abundance of summer zucchini thank you,0
when the grill is hot grill the wedge cut-side-down for about 2 minute then flip them and grill them skin-side-down for an additional 3-4 minute until grill mark form,0

what is your favorite brand or two of kalamata olive thank you carol the7thdecade,0
my olive of choice are kalamata olive commonly used in greek food their salty briny flavor is delectable alongside the feta and crisp veggie instead of slicing large tomato i use cherry tomato because they release le water into the salad than larger tomato would i also seed my cucumber to avoid making my salad watery,0
i’m so glad you love the salad,0
love this recipe but a someone who’s a native greek it is not traditional traditional greek salad horiatiki salata meaning village salad is tomato onion and cucumber there is no pepper olive and slice of feta are added the dressing is usually red wine vinegar evoo & oregano we never use mustard in any of our salad dressing the red wine vinegar can be swapped out if you do not like the taste,0
i absolutely adore this recipe i return to it time and time again because it’s that good the different taste meld together so well and the taste only deepens a the dressing doe it magic i’m so glad i found this recipe and this website,0

hi chris i’m so glad you loved the taco i think daiya cheese is alright it’s definitely a personal preference since it doesn’t taste exactly like cheese this pizza could go without cheese since the spread are creamy and flavorful if you baked the crust first roasted the artichoke separately and assembled the pizza out of the oven it’s more of a flatbread that way but it would be yummy nonetheless hope that help,0

2 135-ounce can full-fat coconut milk refrigerated overnight 2½ tablespoon maple syrup 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract 1 tablespoon lemon zest pinch of sea salt 1-2 tablespoon lemon juice optional depending on thickness of your cream,1
scoop the coconut solid that have risen to the top of the can and spoon it into a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment make sure the solid have separated from the coconut water in the can - if it mix your coconut cream will not whip save the leftover coconut water for smoothy beat the on high speed until it begin to thicken and and peak form dont over-mix or your cream will soften too much add the maple syrup vanilla salt and lemon zest and mix until combined if your coconut cream is very thick add 1 to 2 tablespoon lemon juice if desired if your cream isnt thick enough for the additional liquid skip the lemon juice chill the cream in the fridge until youre ready to serve,2

can i eliminate the banana what would i use instead of the banana,0
1 if you make this the night before one of two thing can happen it will dry out and burn more easily the next morning or the bottom will get so soggy it will have an almost slimy consistency the next day my suggestion here is if you make it the night before try using a fruit that isnt banana or strawberry i had peach and it wa perfect,0

½ cup whole milk greek yogurt see vegan note ¼ cup mayonnaise sir kensington’s is best here 1 chipotle pepper from a can of chipotle in adobo sauce 1 garlic clove peeled 1 teaspoon lime juice 1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 teaspoon honey or maple syrup sea salt and freshly ground black pepper,1
in a food processor place the yogurt mayo chipotle pepper garlic lime juice olive oil honey and generous pinch of salt and freshly ground black pepper and blend until smooth season to taste with more salt and pepper if desired,2
i’m so glad you loved it,0
can i just use greakyogurt and no mayo,0
in this recipe i balance the heat of the chipotle with sweetness from honey richness from greek yogurt & mayonnaise and brightness from lime to make an addictive sauce that’s a bit lighter than a traditional chipotle aioli and no need to worry if you’re vegan – maple syrup and vegan mayo work perfectly in place of the honey yogurt and traditional mayonnaise,0
this chipotle sauce is perfect i’ve made it every week for the last month for taco tuesday and it’s such a hit don’t debate trying it you’ll love it i’ve frozen remaining chipotle pepper separately in an ice cube tray after opening the can and defrosted what i need on the day i make the sauce and it is still wonderful,0

1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 tablespoon lemon juice 12 tablespoon tahini 12 tablespoon water 12 garlic clove minced 14 teaspoon ground turmeric sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper ¾ cup sauerkraut or other fermented veggie 2 tablespoon sesame seed or hemp seed microgreens optional sea salt and freshly cracked black pepper,1
make the sauce in a small bowl mix together the olive oil lemon juice tahini water garlic turmeric and generous pinch of salt and pepper set aside thinly slice the radish this is best done on a mandolin and toss the slice with a squeeze of lemon set aside cook the mung bean in boiling salted water according to package direction or until tender drain in a steamer basket over a pot of simmering water steam the carrot covered until just tender 7 to 10 minute remove and set aside next steam the broccoli until tender but still bright green 4 to 5 minute lastly steam the kale until just tender 30 second to 1 minute assemble individual bowl with the brown rice mung bean carrot broccoli kale sauerkraut sesame seed and microgreens if using season with salt and pepper and serve with the turmeric tahini sauce,2
a vibrant turmeric tahini sauce is the star of this delicious veggie bowl it add a pop of bright flavor to the mix of fresh vegetable rice and bean,0

i loved this recipe and wa happy and surprised that my meat-loving husband loved it a well i did pile on the kimchi my fermented veggie of choice but still thought the sauce wa delicious albeit light on it own i saved a lot of time by piling the steaming veggie on top of each other depending on how long they needed to cook carrot first then broccoli with 5 minute remaining kale the last minute i made a big batch for lunch throughout the week definitely a keeper,0
when we lived in austin i headed to a macrobiotic restaurant called casa de luz whenever i craved a nourishing cleansing veggie bowl like this one instead of offering a menu it serf one rotating meal that always contains a grain a legume blanched green steamed vegetable a pickled vegetable and a delicious sauce it may sound limiting but i’ve honestly had some of the best sauce and vegetable pairing of my life there if you’re ever in austin make sure you check it out,0
these component all keep nicely in the fridge if you want to meal prep them for lunch or dinner during the week and an extra tip – be careful with the turmeric sauce in your kitchen i love it bright color but it can easily stain thing yellow,0

1 12 cup cooked chickpea drained and rinsed extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling sea salt paprika curry powder or other spice optional,1
preheat the oven to 425°f and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper spread the chickpea on a kitchen towel and pat them dry remove any loose skin transfer the dried chickpea to the baking sheet and toss them with a drizzle of olive oil and generous pinch of salt roast the chickpea for 20 to 30 minute or until golden brown and crisp oven can vary if your chickpea are not crispy enough keep going until they are remove from the oven and while the chickpea are still warm toss with pinch of your favorite spice if using store roasted chickpea in a loosely-covered container at room temperature they are best used within two day,2
most of mine never got crunchy i ended up with some burnt and the rest just chewy any suggestion,0
enter roasted chickpea they still have all the protein and heartiness of regular chickpea but they’ve become an irresistible salty crunchy ingredient even better they’re a great healthy vegan snack on their own,0
i made these and baked them for 45 min they were soft but would be great on a salad but not a an alone snack,0
great idea thank you i will do it,0
hi echo they’ll just get a little le crispy after the first day in the fridge but they should still taste great i store them this way all the time,0
1 spaghetti squash extra-virgin olive oil sea salt and freshly ground black pepper,1
preheat the oven to 400°f slice the spaghetti squash in half lengthwise and scoop out the seed and ribbing drizzle the inside of the squash with olive oil and sprinkle with salt and pepper place the spaghetti squash cut side down on the baking sheet and use a fork to poke hole roast for 30 to 40 minute or until lightly browned on the outside fork tender but still a litte bit firm the time will vary depending on the size of your squash i also find that the timing can vary from squash to squash remove from the oven and flip the squash so that it’s cut side up when cool to the touch use a fork to scrape and fluff the strand from the side of the squash,2
comment,0
amazing and delicious simple cooked it for myself and my 1 year old for the first time he loved it thanks,0
i’ve never been happy with spaghetti squash when i cooked it in the past but i decided to give it one more try some great tip were provided and i think that’s what made it turn out perfect this time i’m guessing i always overlooked it super easy great result,0
awww so glad you both loved it,0
a mistake i used to make wa roasting my squash too long i used to roast it for an hour or longer but now i roast it for 30 to 40 minute i initially thought the squash needed to be super soft and fork tender in order for the strand to “spaghetti” but over the year i’ve learned that i prefer my strand to be more al dente and le mushy and that the 1 hour mark wa too long of course the timing will entirely depend on the size of your squash and the heat of your particular oven it can also vary from squash to squash so adjust your cooking time accordingly,0

i wa so excited about this soup sadly the soup wasn’t edible the limelemon juice overpowered the whole pot and i even used le than what the recipe called for i wa so excited about this soup a it seemed like a fun twist from the regular miso sup i make… so it wa quite unfortunate that we had to throw the whole pot away,0
i round this soup out with scallion ginger turmeric carrot and bok choy and i add tofu for extra protein instead of filling the soup with lot and lot of noodle i used half rice noodle and half zucchini noodle this way you still get that satisfying feeling that come with eating a bowl of noodle the soup is finished with a pop of lemon & lime and a bit of sriracha it’s like a healthy veggie hot and sour soup it’s a little punchy a little earthy and a little spicy i hope you enjoy,0

great cookie but a bit too sweet for me when i make it again i’ll cut back on the maple syrup and will probably use 38 cup,0
thank you for this recipe—i love these cooky and have made them many time i think i like them just a much with dried cranberry a i do with pomegranate aril if not more the aril make for a more delicate taste and i end up saving them for more special occasion the dried cranberry seems to me to make more of an all-around comfort cookie even if it cut against the middle eastern influence of the original tahini-pomegranate recipe,0

thank you it wa delicious elevates chickpea into something a lot more substantial and love the way the herb and spice balance with the sweetness of the squash we are lucky enough to get garden fresh squash from my husband’s workplace a local private school with a gardening program and i thought i had done everything that could be done with squash so this creative tasty dish saved me ps–sorry i freaked out a little in my initial post but we live in the mountain outside aspen co and the nearest supermarket is 10 mile from our house,0
1 large butternut squash 5 to 6 cup peeled seeded and cubed extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling ½ cup coconut cream see note ¼ cup maple syrup 1 tablespoon coconut oil 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 teaspoon cinnamon ¼ teaspoon nutmeg ¼ teaspoon ginger ⅛ teaspoon sea salt 2 to 6 tablespoon almond milk if necessary to blend optional topping coconut cream chocolate shaving toasted pecan,1
preheat the oven to 425°f and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper arrange the squash cube on the baking sheet and toss with just a little bit of olive oil roast for 30 to 35 minute or until tender note the squash doe not need to be golden brown just very soft transfer the squash to a blender and add the coconut cream maple syrup coconut oil vanilla cinnamon nutmeg ginger and salt blend until smooth adding almond milk if necessary to reach a blendable consistency taste and adjust the sweetness and spice to your liking transfer to ramekin or bowl and chill 4 hour or overnight serve with desired topping,2
i’ve already reviewed this 5 star but i’ve made it so many time now i’ve noticed a couple thing that make a difference in the texture so i thought i’d share the most important one is the coconut oil must be melted before adding otherwise the texture can become grainy keep in mind if you pour melted coconut oil over cold squash or cold coconut cream it’s going to solidify and get grainy so try to work with all your main ingredient warm or hot also if your coconut cream is split into hard cream and watery milk an effective solution is to gently heat it microwave or stovetop which blend it back together quickly when the fat are liquid and warm you get a smoother creamier pudding,0
hi leia i’m so glad you loved it,0
wow love how creative this is great dish thank you,0
jeanine seriously this is like pumpkin pie without the crust it’s so good a is and i have also swirled in peanut butter which i have to say is amazing,0
i forgot to mention – this is recommended to be served chilled but i love it warm even more it’s lighter with a softer mouth feel both way work,0

love this site and these were yummy but we thought they were just a bit dry i used a creamy high quality peanut butter but looking at the photo the peanut butter used look more runny in texture also i noticed the link to the almond flour brings up “almond flour yellow cake mix” is that what you used i used bob red mill super fine natural almond flour so that could be the issue a well next time would use a bit le flour or add a bit of water to compensate just an observation in case you’re using peanut butter with a similar texture or a similar almond flour,0
hi rhona it’ll be thicker you may need to add a little water if it’s too dry and not coming together,0

for the filling i gathered the usual ingredient that i would stuff into vietnamese spring roll – avocado cucumber tofu radish and noodle i felt like it needed a little more so i thought what i often think in the summer – “peaches” peach and basil are a tasty pairing and in my opinion it’s the season to throw peach slice on everything if peach aren’t in season use slice of ripe mango instead or skip the fruit altogether,0
all of the fresh herb that we have growing on our little deck inspired this recipe for summer roll we have a ton of basil and some very fragrant thai basil among other plant like thai chile tomato pepper and even fig we’re very proud of our little plant escape and when i say “we” i mean that i’m very proud that jack ha been lovingly watering everything up to twice a day to keep it all going this might be the longest that we’ve actually kept plant alive,0

1 cup raw slivered almond 2 tablespoon white miso paste 2 garlic clove ½ teaspoon dijon mustard 1 cup almond breeze almondmilk original unsweetened ¼ cup fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil ½ teaspoon sea salt 10 ounce shell pasta 1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil 3 cup brussels sprout sliced in half 2 tablespoon white wine or water to deglaze the pan 2 scallion sliced sea salt and freshly ground black pepper 1 tablespoon panko bread crumb 1 tablespoon hemp seed ⅛ teaspoon sea salt extra-virgin olive oil for drizzling ¼ cup chopped fresh herb chive tarragon or parsley,1
preheat the oven to 400°f and brush a 7x9-inch or similar size baking dish with olive oil make the white miso sauce in a high speed blender combine the almond miso paste garlic dijon mustard almond milk lemon juice olive oil and salt and blend until smooth make the pasta bring a large pot of salted water to a boil prepare the pasta according to the instruction on the package cooking until al dente drain and toss with a little olive oil to keep the pasta from sticking together heat the 1 tablespoon olive oil in a medium skillet over mediumhigh heat add the brussels sprout and cook stirring occasionally until browned and tender 6 to 8 minute remove from the heat add the wine and stir to scrape up any bit that have stuck to the bottom of the pan add the cooked pasta the scallion and the miso sauce to the pan stir to coat then transfer to the baking dish top with the panko bread crumb hemp seed a few pinch of salt cheese if using and drizzle the top with olive oil bake covered for 15 minute or until the brussels sprout are fully tender and the dish is just warmed through this short cooking time will prevent the filling from drying out remove from the oven sprinkle with the fresh herb and serve,2
the secret to this vegan pasta bake is a velvety savory almond-miso sauce that creates a creamy coating for the veggie and pasta,0
after the brussels sprout are decently browned combine with the pasta and pour on the sauce it will seem like a lot of sauce but we want a creamy pasta bake so sauce it up,0
so saucy,0
once you have everything in the baking dish you could technically top this pasta bake with a cup of melty mozzarella cheese or a healthy shaving of fresh parmesan cheese if you live with picky eater you may want to go that route if you’re like me you’ll top it with a sprinkle of hemp seed panko bread crumb and a generous drizzle of olive oil bake then top with chive andor tarragon,0

so i decided to use my mom’s seven layer dip recipe a a starting point and actually made a fresh vegan version that taste pretty close to the original the only visual difference is the lack of orange cheese but all of the classic to me flavor really come through especially with the refried bean and tangy guacamole instead of sour cream i used cashew cream and i added chili spiced quinoa to make it heartier this should serve 4 to 6 a a normal appetizer but of course jack and i sat down and devoured most of it for dinner,0

i have a huge weakness for seven layer dip growing up my mom made it for so many holiday and gathering i’d be sure to grab a seat at the table right next to it so that i could gobble it up chip after chip after chip after chip in my family this wa and still is called tex mex dip when jack and i were first dating he thought this wa hilarious and once i moved down to texas with him i learned why – this dip is neither tex nor mex in the intervening year i also learned that i don’t like anyone else’s version except my mom’s hers may not be tex mex but i love it and it doesn’t have weird thing like olive,0

wow the salad sound wonderful and those moroccan pickled carrot if you get the recipe please please share i love moroccan flavor and i would love to have the kind of garden you saw in madison two thing work against that 1 i live in the desert and 2 i ran out of serious garden energy year ago i hope you get to have your farm garden while you can still enjoy it not everyone run out of energy for thing like that,0
i second the request for the moroccan carrot recipe sound intriguing,0
something that i didn’t know before this trip is that sub-zero and wolf appliance are made right here in madison we toured both factory floor and while they didn’t let u take photo of their proprietary process it wa fascinating to watch the appliance being built from start to finish and to learn about the rigorous testing they do at each and every step it gave me peace of mind knowing that the appliance in our home are going to last through the rigor that we put them through – holiday cookbook and more i wa also reassured that if i or anyone have a problem with an appliance someone from madison not overseas will be on top of the repair,0
hosting holiday is so fun i think we have like 20 people this year and i am so excited this salad look beautiful i can’t wait to see what else you make,0
what a special trip and a gorgeous salad to go along with it,0

buon appetito,0
now that the weather is cooling off this mushroom pasta is our kind of weeknight recipe it’s quick to toss together which is the beauty of pasta but it’s also yummy satisfying and very flexible for example if you don’t have tarragon and chive rosemary andor sage would be delicious you could also sub in gluten-free pasta if you want to or even spaghetti squash and there’s a vegan option below to use cashew cream instead of regular cream of course if you’re not vegan top this with fresh parmigiano-reggiano or pecorino or parmesan cheese because this recipe is inspired by parma after all,0
this recipe obviously start with the mushroom i used sliced cremini mushroom but by all mean mix in other variety such a chanterelle mushroom or oyster mushroom if you want to get crazy the rest of these ingredient – olive oil garlic herb and a touch of cashew cream with dijon mustard – seem so simple but they compliment the mushroom in such a delicious way specifically if you’ve never tried tarragon before it ha an aniselicorice flavor that you might not love at first sniff but it really make the deep savory flavor of the mushroom pop,0

we had these for dinner tonight and they are fabulous we are new vegetarian and have been looking for some good taco alternative and these really hit the spot,0
yum i am obsessed with these,0
these were incredible i used half yogurt half sour cream for the sauce because i didn’t have any mayo and i used sweet potato in place of butternut squash and it all turned out amazing,0
this recipe start with a pretty darn awesome sauce if i do say so myself roasted poblanos onion and garlic get mixed with lime juice cilantro and the best mayo on the planet – sir kensington’s avocado oil mayonnaise if you’ve been following me for a while you know how much i love sir kensington’s condiment see here here and here they source the best ingredient and their ketchup mustard and mayo just taste so darn good because of it i could eat this mayo straight from the jar but since this blog is about recipe i whipped it up into this spicy tangy sauce to go with the butternut squash taco btw if you’re vegan go ahead and make this with sir k’s fabanaise,0
a the squash roast in the oven make a quick slaw with a scoop of the poblano sauce,0

4 large tortilla i used these several handful of spinach leaf - about 8 per wrap 1 cucumber cut into long thin slice - 2 per wrap 2-3 mixed mild pepper - about 6 slice per wrap fresh parsley sprig optional tofu or other choice of protein optional sprinkle of hemp seed optional 1 15-ounce can chickpea drained and rinsed ¼ cup vegetable broth or water 3 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 2 tablespoon tahini 1 garlic clove ½ teaspoon sea salt ¼ cup fresh parsley ⅛ teaspoon cumin ⅛ teaspoon smoked paprika freshly ground black pepper to taste 1½ cup packed fresh spinach,1
make the spinach hummus in a food processor combine the chickpea vegetable broth lemon juice tahini garlic salt parsley cumin paprika and black pepper and blend well add the spinach and blend again chill until ready to use to assemble the wrap spread about ¼ cup of hummus on each wrap leaving a ½-inch border around the edge add the spinach leaf followed by the cucumber and pepper slice top with the fresh parsley protein of choice and hemp seed if using roll up the wrap and then wrap in foil refrigerate until until ready to use,2
finally it’s time to roll because i use small tortilla for these vegan wrap i skip tucking in the side and simply roll them up,0
this bright hummus wrap is layered with crisp fresh veggie hemp seed and a light spinach hummus - perfect for packing for a healthy lunch,0
obviously a good hummus wrap start with good hummus so step 1 is blending up the fresh bright “glue” that hold these together it’s a very light very green hummus made with chickpea tahini some vegetable broth which keep these light because you can use a little le tahini garlic spice handful of spinach and a bit of parsley,0

easy to double the recipe for leftover but you do lose some of the al dente bite to the orzo which may mean using a grain like farro or einkorn might be a good replacement for leftover a they’d keep the bite,0

you knowwe just moved to atlanta from columbus oh and our jalapeño’s in ohio never packed this much heat the sauce wa fine but i used chobani greek yogurt for the sauce instead of the almond milk and chopped almond since i have a tree nut allergy i wonder if that’s what cooled the sauce down it wa the chopped jalapeño’s that we put on top of the bowl that were too hot,0

2 lemongrass stalk extra piece for garnish big handful of mint about 15 mint leaf plus 2 sprig for garnish 8 basil leaf chopped 2 teaspoon truvia natural sweetener 5 tablespoon fresh lime juice plus 2 slice for garnish 6 tablespoon white rum 3 ounce crushed ice ½ cup sparkling water more a needed,1
prepare the lemongrass by cutting off the root end and the tough upper stem of the stalk next peel off the tough outer layer leaving the more tender pale lower section with the back of a chef’s knife bash the inner leaf to release the lemongrass oil and make it more fragrant and flavorful finely chop this should yield about 3 tablespoon in a cocktail shaker combine the lemongrass mint basil and truvia muddle with a cocktail muddler or the back of a large spoon add the lime juice rum and a handful of ice shake well prepare 2 glass with more crushed ice strain the cocktail mixture into the glass adding a small spoonful of the muddled herb top with sparkling water and garnish each glass with a sprig of mint and a 4-inch piece of the lemongrass stalk,2
yes truvia can cause digestive upset so can all artificial sweetener i know that the base of truvia is stevia which is a plant but the truth is that truvia is so processed that there really isn’t anything natural about it any longer that is just my personal opinion i also greatly dislike the taste of stevia to me it taste like aspartame but if it work for other people i prefer xylitol – which is made of birch bark and taste like sugar it too of course is very processed i just like the taste better,0
i hope your herb garden is ready because instead of the basic mint mojito these are made with lemongrass and basil a well basically i like to build cocktail the same way i approach salad – the more fresh herb and citrus the better,0
the next step isn’t pictured but you want to take the back of your chef’s knife and bash that inner stalk so that the flavor of the lemongrass release after that dice it finely like this,0
it a wonderful recipe it look so natural worthy trying,0
yes i love a good skinny mojito and this one look so good and refreshing with all those great herb loving the beautiful clean and birght picture 🙂,0

in a large skillet heat ½ teaspoon of olive oil over medium heat add the onion and cook until soft about 2 minute add the mushroom pinch of salt and pepper and cook until browned and soft 5 to 8 minute add ½ cup of the black bean garlic the balsamic vinegar and tamari sauce and cook for 2 minute or until everything is well browned and soft remove the mixture from the heat and let cool slightly in a food processor pulse the walnut add the mushroom mixture and pulse 2 to 3 time until just combined do not puree or the mixture will be too mushy add the remaining ½ cup of black bean and pulse briefly transfer the mixture to a large bowl and stir in the brown rice chili powder onion powder salt and pepper mix until combined taste and adjust seasoning preheat the oven to 400°f and line a large baking sheet with parchment paper spread the panko breadcrumb onto a plate form the mixture into 18-1½ inch ball and gently roll in the crumb using the breadcrumb to pat the mixture into cohesive ball place on the baking sheet and refrigerate for 20 minute or overnight drizzle generously with olive oil and bake for 35 to 40 minute carefully flipping halfway through heat the marinara sauce in a skillet and add the meatball heat until just warmed through and serve immediately on the bun with arugula basil and parmesan cheese if desired tip don’t let the meatball sit in the sauce for too long or they will start to fall apart,2
this meatball recipe is fantastic–my family loved it and it’s definitely going into our regular rotation i wa a little hesitant at first since i’m not usually a fan of ‘vegan’ recipe but these meatball were delicious the only issue i had wa that i’m not sure if i would use them a a substitute for regular meatball the texture is different and they don’t have that ‘meaty’ flavor that i love however they’re still an excellent option for a healthy hearty meal thanks for the great recipe,0
look amazing do you think it’s possible to skip the walnut i have a nut and seed allergy,0
do these freeze ok can i make a batch with all the eggplant i have and freeze always my go to question- with kids- is it freezable,0
hi not in this recipe they provide texture so they’re not just mushy,0
i really loved this meatball recipe there were plenty of them so ended up freezing a few a well the only issue for me is i would have liked them to be a little firmer they are very delicate and after following this recipe mine basically collapsed in the oven i felt the it wa too long in the oven for something that wa essentially already cooked the next lot i used from the freezer i gently pan fried carefully turning them over with a spoon and also did a little experiment with a deep fry which also worked very well thanks for this recipe tho o will keep using it for sure but will cook them my way,0

hi erin – yep normal radish would be just fine or you can skip it altogether i probably wouldn’t re-warm the sweet potato or they’ll get soggy the sweet potato can be served at room temp but i’d probably roast them close to serving time so that they don’t get too soft hope that help,0

2 medium sweet potato spiralized 1 to 2 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil enough to well coat the pan 3 garlic clove thinly sliced sliced ¼ teaspoon red pepper flake more a desired 2 to 3 tablespoon water 4 cup baby kale or thinly sliced lacinato kale sea salt and freshly ground black pepper squeeze of fresh lemon juice a desired ⅓ cup fresh basil sliced dollop of pesto this recipe with basil in place of kale 2 tablespoon hemp seed or toasted pine nut grated pecorino cheese optional,1
peel the sweet potato slice in half and and cut the pointy tip off place in the spiralizer and spiralize into noodle alternatively you can use a julienne peeler although this is more difficult so i recommend spiralizing heat the oil in a large deep skillet over medium heat add the garlic and cook until until the garlic slice are lightly golden brown about 5 minute reducing the heat if necessary ie if the olive oil is bubbling too much turn the heat down you do not want the garlic to burn add a few generous pinch of salt red pepper flake and a few grind of freshly cracked black pepper add the sweet potato noodle and toss to coat let cook for 2 minute gently tossing and scraping down the side of the pan add 2 to 3 tablespoon of water and toss again to ensure that nothing is sticking to the bottom of the pan cover and let the sweet potato noodle continue for 5 more minute or until they start to soften and are tender but still have a crisp “al dente” bite check and toss occasionally so that they cook evenly be careful not to overcook or they will start to break apart this happens quickly during the last minute of cooking stir in the kale so that it wilt into the noodle remove from heat and transfer to 3 or 4 bowl serve with the fresh basil a dollop of pesto hemp seed or pine nut and pecorino cheese if desired,2
sweet potato noodle inject the classic spaghetti aglio e olio with brilliant color in this easy dish i love to top mine with basil & plenty of parmesan,0
p i’m a big fan of the inspiralizer because unlike the other type that i’ve tried it clamp down to your countertop making the “noodling” process far le frustrating and you won’t have sweet potato all over your floor,0
notify me of follow-up comment via e-mail,0
like the others have said i’d almost given up on spiralizing because of the hassle — but haven’t tried the inspiralizer this dish is so incredibly beautiful — i’m giving it another try,0

1 cup raw hulled sunflower seed 1 cup unsweetened shredded coconut ⅓ cup for rolling ½ teaspoon cinnamon ½ teaspoon sea salt 12 soft medjool date pitted and soaked if they’re very dry ⅔ cup chopped carrot 2 teaspoon maple syrup more to taste,1
in a food processor combine the sunflower seed 1 cup shredded coconut cinnamon and salt and pulse until it becomes a fine meal add the date and carrot and pulse until the mixture combine and stick together taste and add more maple syrup if you would like your bite sweeter if the mixture is too dry add more maple syrup if it’s too moist add more coconut andor let the mix chill in the fridge for 20 minute to firm up use a tablespoon to scoop the mixture then use your hand to roll it into approximately 1-inch ball roll in the remaining coconut to coat the outside if desired store in the fridge in an air-tight container for up to 5 day,2
i recommend grinding the sunflower seed very fine in the initial step and grating the carrot instead of chopping to help with the final texture the flavor and simplicity wa nice,0
any suggestion for what to use a a substitute for sunflower seed i am allergic to them 😪 i really really want to make these,0
these sound great but im trying to advoid dried fruit can the date be left out,0

sound exciting must try this recipe we could all do with a little le coffee 🙂 thanks for sharing,0
i used light canned coconut milk and mixed it with almond milk you can also just get the coconut milk beverage that come in carton and skip the almond milk part – either way work,0
it’s lightly sweet nicely spiced and creamy from the combination of coconut milk and almond milk i love it with a grind of black pepper which sound a little weird but “they” say that the anti-inflammatory property of turmeric are activated when combined with black pepper which is why indian curry contain turmeric and also black pepper i wa scared at first but i think it add such an interesting spicy kick… and this is coming from the girl that used to despise pepper let me know what you think if you give it a try 🙂,0
may i ask you what is acv thank you,0
1 cup raw shelled pistachio 1 cup rolled oat ½ teaspoon sea salt ¼ cup maple syrup more for drizzling on top 2 tablespoon olive oil ⅓ cup unsweetened coconut flake additional handful of chopped pistachio for the topping,1
preheat the oven to 350 degree and line an 8-inch square pan with parchment paper in a food processor with the s blade attached process the pistachio oat and salt for about 30 second until a meal start to form drizzle in the maple syrup and olive oil while the motor is still running and the meal begin to come together into a crumbly almost-wet dough press the dough evenly into the pan and cover it with coconut flake and remaining pistachio bake for 10 to 12 minute until the coconut is nice and golden brown and the dough is cooked through you want the square to still be a little soft - dont overbake these carefully lift the cooled dough out of the pan by holding two side of the parchment paper cut it into square drizzle a little maple syrup over the top for extra sweetness if you like store the square in a sealed container for up to a week,2
unfortunately it wa a disaster a i unwittingly used salted nut i tripled the other ingredient to try and dilute the salt but have just ended up wasting good ingredient,0
might you have the nutritional fact for these,0
i calculated the calorie in myfitnesspal and for the entire pan not including pistachio sprinkled on top it’s 1200 calorie so if you cut 12 square each will be 100 calorie,0
unfortunately it wa a disaster a i unwittingly used salted nut i tripled the other ingredient to try and dilute the salt but have just ended up wasting good ingredient,0
how many calorie are in each piece please,0

hidden in this spaghetti bolognese recipe are some unconventional ingredient i find that balsamic vinegar and soy sauce bring out a rich flavor in the mushroom sage to me ha a sausage-like scent so i used a bit of dried sage to bring a depth of flavor to the sauce in addition to the lentil i added some finely crushed walnut that you won’t detect but they add some richness to this no-meat situation,0

there’s a shaved brussels sprout salad in our cookbook page 68 that’s one of my go-to salad in the fall andor winter it ha a tangy citrusy dressing and it’s tossed with cranberry and pine nut a few week ago while i wa planning to make that salad for thanksgiving i saw a sprout and ricotta toast recipe on epicurious and got the idea that my favorite little salad would make a bright festive appetizer instead of using ricotta cheese to hold the filling onto the toast i used smashed avocado – because i can never resist yet another seasonal avocado toast,0

lately these vegetarian black bean enchilada have become one of our favorite dinner for cold night the spicy gooey tortilla and hearty veggie filling are the ultimate form of comfort food i highly recommend you try them out this fall but before you make them here’s my 1 enchilada tip spread the enchilada sauce down the center of the enchilada only leaving the tortilla edge exposed that way you’ll get a delicious contrast between the soft saucy part and the dry edge that crisp up in the oven,0

yay i’m so glad you both loved it hope your friend enjoy it too 🙂,0
the texture of that carrot queso look perfect i’m pretty hooked on my cashew-based cheese but this make me really want to try adding in potato 🙂,0
i served my vegan queso with amy’s nacho cheese and bean snack – which make this whole thing pretty indulgent but remember that the dip is still made of carrot and besides it’s the holiday so let’s live a little,0
i love the idea of adding carrot into the “queso” dip very creative,0
2½ cup unsweetened almond milk 2 tablespoon cacao powder i use nativas natural 1 tablespoon maca powder i use essential living food 2 tablespoon maple syrup or to taste ½ teaspoon coconut oil pinch of cinnamon tiny pinch of sea salt coconut whip see homemade instruction below shaved dark chocolate,1
in a blender mix the almond milk cacao powder maca maple syrup coconut oil cinnamon and salt you can also whisk this together by hand transfer to a small saucepan and warm over medium heat taste and adjust the sweetness if desired if it too thick add a little more almond milk serve with coconut whip and shaved dark chocolate both optional,2
hi brett i think the microwave would be fine just whisk well to make sure there are no lump from the powder or sift them first i think the pre-mixed jar would be fine if you have a tight fitting lid so that you can shake them well before pouring,0
thankyou so much this hot cacao ha been a game changer so nourishing and yet so comforting and delicious my new favourite 4pm drink 🙂,0

but even potluck have changed over the year which is why she wa inspired to write this book these day there are thing like dietary restriction and “instagram worthiness” to consider also people have become more food savvy and there’s always pressure to bring a standout dish she wrote modern potluck to give people updated foolproof crowd-pleasing recipe that will hold up on the buffet table… and to bring people together around food in a way that’s a easy and fun a possible one of my favorite part of the book is that every recipe ha a “potluck prep” tip that tell you how to prepare the recipe in advance how long the recipe will sit out for etc etc,0

2 medium ripe avocado ¼ cup chocolate chip melted see note 3 tablespoon cacao powder 3 tablespoon maple syrup 3 tablespoon almond butter 1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract 2 cup almond breeze almondmilk vanilla ¼ teaspoon sea salt ½ cup chocolate chip ½ teaspoon coconut oil crushed nut such a almond or pistachio,1
scoop the avocado into a blender along with the melted chocolate chip cacao powder maple syrup almond butter vanilla almond milk and sea salt blend until smooth pour into ice pop mold and freeze overnight or for at least 9 hour to remove the pop let them sit at room temperature for a few minute until the pop are loose enough to pull out optional topping melt the additional chocolate chip together with the coconut oil drizzle on the pop and sprinkle the crushed nut on top alternatively you can enjoy this a pudding in non-pop form after you blend the mixture scoop it into a bowl or individual bowl and chill in the fridge for at least 4 hour,2

i hadn’t had a pudding pop in year until i started making these this summer and boy did they bring back the memory in my childhood frozen thing on stick life except i promise these taste so much better than any pre-packaged pop,0

i made these i opted to double the cocoa powder which gave it a richer taste i had a great time filling up my mold while i wa filling up my stomach with the pudding concoction i couldn’t resist,0

1½ cup edamame ¼ cup basil 3 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 1 tablespoon chopped scallion ½ small garlic clove 2 tablespoon olive oil 1 to 3 tablespoon water ½ teaspoon sea salt more to taste 1 large baguette handful of baby salad green or arugula 2-3 medium tomato sliced 10 basil leaf 10 jarred roasted artichoke cut into quarter or roughly chopped pine nut optional,1
make the basil-edamame spread place the edamame basil lemon juice scallion garlic and sea salt into the bowl of a food processor pulse until chopped add the olive oil and blend until smooth add up to 3 tablespoon of water to create a smooth spreadable consistency season to taste and chill until ready to use the filling can be in advance and stored in the fridge for 3 to 4 day slice one large baguette in half and assemble with the basil-edamame spread green tomato basil artichoke and pine nut close the baguette wrap it in foil and place in the fridge until youre ready to divide into serving slice into 4 individual serving and either wrap them to go or enjoy,2
assemble this early in the day at least a few hour before your picnic or even the night before so that the sweet tomato-basil juice do that thing where they mingle together and partially soak into the middle of the bread i like to assemble this using one large baguette wrap it up store it in the fridge and then slice it into individual portion just before i’m ready to pack them up,0
well i’m not typically a fan of these kind of spread but for some reason this one intrigued me – maybe because i adore edamame bean maybe it’s because the colour looked so delicious maybe it’s because i’m a little delerious thanks to extreme in humidity level here in ontario canada anyway whatever the reason i just made it and it is absolutely delicious so refreshing and definitely crave-worthy i did add a bit of ground pepper to the mix and didn’t have scallion so just used some chopped onion i simply had it on a slice of dave’s killer bread with sliced tomato it’s all i can do not to have another wonderful thank you,0
made this for lunch today and i have a small suggestion maybe give the artichoke a rough chop it wa delicious but i had a hard time biting through the artichoke and made a bit of a mess fine for picnic with familyfriends a little awkward in front of co-worker,0
i really need to make more picnic sandwich especially after reading your description of how summery and delicious this one is i have no doubt love how this recipe spotlight simple summer-fresh tomato – there’s nothing better,0
last week i wa in new york speaking at a random house event with one of my favorite blogger ever jenny from dinner a love story we chatted about our shared love for the simple tomato sandwich and how you shouldn’t complicate thing that are a beautiful a summer tomato i forgot that i had this post in the queue – because i absolutely love this slightly fancier tomato-with-other-things sandwich,0

my husband jack really love kiwi he grew up in florida so i always envisioned him growing up among kiwi tree his grandfather had quite the green thumb and jack always tell story of the fruit and vegetable they would pick and eat together he talk about kiwi so much that i had just assumed that this tropical fruit wa part of that picture a well,0
if you’re looking for more fun dip try my favorite tomatillo salsa mango salsa or guacamole,0
this is a sponsored post in partnership with garden of eatin’ i wa compensated for my time however a always opinion are my own,0
last week when i wa trying to dream up a unique salsa recipe i thought kiwi would be fun and different and most importantly – jack would love it it’s not a fruit i typically reach for to me it just seems more like a florida thing that one should eat while in florida if you have a magical fruity backyard and that’s when i wa shocked to find out that kiwi don’t grow in florida at all they grow in california & new zealand- he just coincidentally like kiwi and his childhood kiwi came from the local publix which make for a way le charming story but stay with me this green salsa recipe is delicious nonetheless,0

this cauliflower rice burrito bowl is just a good a one from chipotle but it totally different plant-based ingredient make it refreshing and fun,0
this cauliflower rice burrito bowl delivers all the best part of a chipotle burrito bowl – fajita veggie cilantro lime flavor plenty of black bean and avocado – and skip the worst part aka the food coma that come when you’re done to make it lighter i swap seasoned cauliflower rice for regular rice then instead of piling it with cheese or sour cream i finish it with a creamy cashew green chile sauce the combination is light bright and downright fun i can’t get enough of it,0

last weekend when i brought these artichoke home i thought about re-assigning this task to jack he is the risotto stirrer and the pomegranate seed picker among other useful thing but i decided to go for it myself like a big girl and it really wasn’t so bad if you’re psyching yourself out of artichoke this spring – don’t they take a little time but they’re too good to miss out on,0
there are so many kind of artichoke at the market here in carcassonne and i have always hesitated because of the trimming chore that or you trim just a little and use them a a butter-delivery system but a i am trying to keep my butter intake in line i’ve nixed that your toast look awfully good and avocado really seal the deal,0
thanks for offering an easy recipe to go along with the artichoke prep smart girl i’m one of those who get psyched out of using artichoke sometimes so thanks for the inspiration and for a unique and very enticing recipe,0

i finish my tagliatelle pasta with briny caper fresh herb parmesan cheese and pine nut for crunch you can simmer the sauce while you cook the pasta so the whole thing come together in just over 30 minute hearty delicious and easy to make it’s one of our favorite weeknight dinner,0
the soup that inspired this pasta is a simple clean-out-the-fridge sort of recipe it work with whatever veggie you have on hand and it’s made of largely pantry ingredient the same hold true for this tagliatelle recipe i draw on the building block of my bolognese sauce to make a tangy light tomato sauce with carrot shallot balsamic vinegar and a splash of wine then i stir in white bean for protein use canned or cook your own and a big handful of kale to freshen it up,0
like the soup that inspired it this recipe is flexible feel free to substitute whatever veggie you have on hand for what’s listed here try using yellow onion in place of the shallot butternut squash instead of carrot and chard or spinach in place of the kale chickpea would also be a great substitute for the white bean here,0

my version here is quite a bit different but the concept is the same – pile on load of fresh ingredient and nacho can be healthy or at least healthy-ish if you baked your own tortilla chip these would be a tad healthier,0
hi hannah you could skip the “taco meat” part and just pile your nacho with the other topping or you can make it with tvp ground soy granule you can find them in the bulk aisle of whole food the recipe is in this post httpwwwloveandlemonscomvegan-nachos-cashew-cheese,0

i’ve made this several time and it’s super delicious i decided to up the curry powder to 3 tsp and i wa pretty generous with the salt which i recommend i also used frozen green bean which worked very well the lime and lemon juice really take this dish to the next level the best part is it taste even better the next day a the cardamom really poke through,0
this wa truly delicious i think the lemonlime juice wa key gave it some zing i added a couple tablespoon of brown sugar and more water but altogether excellent,0
i didn’t have muchi curry powder but subbed another curry powder and added some garam masala with great result,0
the flavor of this wa wonderful i’d add the green bean earlier – here they are left too the end with spinach i’m not a raw green bean fan so i had to cook them longer in the lentil mix and everything turned into a mush without enough texture to call it a stew,0
i realize that many of you probably really love lentils… they’re a great source of protein especially if you’re vegan or vegetarian my relationship with lentil ha been so-so but lately i’ve been giving them another chance so far i’ve found that i’m ok with red lentil baby step,0

the only thing i changed in this recipe wa i added some chipotle in adobo sauce instead of the pastepowder because i always have a partly used can in my fridge,0
in this vegan chili recipe butternut squash chipotle & poblanos make a delicious sweet & smoky flavor combination it quick easy & so darn good,0
i’ve made this chili so many time now that i figured it wa time to leave a comment and review ha when i first made this chili i had never used poblano pepper before i wa a little nervous because i wasn’t sure how spicy they were but i’m obsessed now i’m never using a plain green pepper again – poblanos have such a more robust flavor,0
serve your chili with spicy cornbread or a baked or stuffed sweet potato enjoy,0
to make this vegan chili recipe hearty & flavorful i added butternut squash it give the chili bulk without making it overly bean-y and it add a mild sweetness to contrast with the other spicy smoky flavor when i made this chili i had 3 tiny butternut squash on hand but you won’t need 3 to make it just cube up enough squash to equal about two cup if you don’t have squash sweet potato would work well in it place,0

hi michelle i do like spicy food but chipotle spice can also vary esp from paste to powder etc if a dressing is ever too spicy next time try adding more vinegar and olive oil to temper it and fix the spice level to your taste…,0
made this salad this morning for my lunch-time book club … so easy and what a crowd pleaser i did end up going very easy on the chipotle powder couldn’t find paste — about a 12 teaspoon provided enough flavor for me,0
can you recommend some other dressing not spicy for this great salad recipe…thank you,0

2 tablespoon ground flaxseed 6 tablespoon warm water 2 cup flour 1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup spelt or whole wheat 1 teaspoon baking soda 1 teaspoon cinnamon ½ teaspoon sea salt ⅔ cup melted coconut oil 1 cup brown sugar ½ cup pure maple syrup 1 teaspoon vanilla extract 2 cup whole rolled oat not instant 1 cup dried tart cherry ½ cup chocolate chip,1
preheat the oven to 350°f and line a baking sheet with parchment paper in the bottom of your electric stand mixer’s bowl add the flaxseed and water whisk it by hand until well emulsified leave it there to thicken while you mix your dry ingredient in a medium bowl combine the flour baking soda cinnamon and salt set aside to your mixer bowl where you started the flaxseed mixture add the coconut oil brown sugar maple syrup and vanilla mix on medium-high speed until well combined gradually add the dry ingredient mixing after each addition mix on high until the dough is smooth and sticky add the oat tart cherry and chocolate chip and mix on low until all is combined scoop a scant ¼ cup of dough onto the baking sheet repeat to form about 16 large cooky or use a heaping teaspoon and make about 32 smaller one bake for 8-10 minute or until the cooky are golden brown around the edge and still soft in the middle remove from the oven and let them cool on the baking sheet for at least 15 minute,2
i don’t know what i did wrong with these but they are so weird this is the first time i made cooky with coconut oil so i’m guessing that’s the problem they didn’t really brown well or spread and i can really smell and taste the flax and i can taste the baking soda too ah well,0
u could probably use oat flour almond flour or coconut meal maybe… experiment,0
hi holly there’s a brand called sunspire and another one called enjoy life i usually find them at whole food but i’ve seen them in other store too if you can’t find either of those you can chop up a dark chocolate bar one that’s about 60 cacao just read the label to see which one don’t contain dairy hope that help,0
these are so good i only used 12 cup of brown sugar they were plenty sweet and still baked fine no vanilla substituted 12 the coconut oil for apple sauce and then made some of them with butterscotch chip some with just cherry and some with cherry and chocolate they’re delicious thank you,0
i’m really sorry these weren’t for you – i really love them i’m not sure what could have gone wrong,0

i’m not going to exactly call this healthy – but a far a cheesecake go it’s definitely a skinnier cousin it ha le overall cheese and le sugar just a few tablespoon of maple syrup actually it’s topped with my favorite dessert fruit – tart cherry – which have some major superfood property they’re a natural anti-inflammatory a well a a source of melatonin which help regulate sleep while this is not a famous family recipe it’s creamy and delicious the bright pop of tart cherry are really well the cherry on top,0
if you live in an area where you can get montmorency tart cherry seek them out – or look for them frozen in your local retailer nationwide i personally love them frozen because a they thaw their natural juice become a sweet tangy sauce,0
mmm those look like some delicious parfait love the bright red cherry filling 🙂,0

first off – you don’t need to go out and buy a spiralizer to make these if you’re going to invest in a gadget i highly recommend the julienne peeler because it’s inexpensive work great and is small enough to fit in your utensil drawer but if you really want curly noodle and you have an extra shelf to spare spring for the spiralizer i have both for no good reason at all,0

1 can full fat coconut milk 1 to 2 teaspoon matcha see note ½ cup sugar 2 tablespoon maple syrup ½ teaspoon vanilla squeeze of lemon 1 tablespoon vodka optional - to help texture once it’s frozen pinch of salt,1
make sure the bowl of your ice cream maker ha been in the freezer for at least 12 hour 24 is best whisk together the matcha sugar maple syrup vanilla lemon salt and vodka if using if your matcha is lumpy you can strain the mixture before putting it into your ice cream maker pour into your ice cream maker and churn according to manufacturer direction pour into a freezer-safe container and freeze for at least 1-2 hour to firm up a bit if your ice cream ha frozen over night let it sit at room temp for 15 minute to soften again,2
when we go to japan our favorite treat is the matcha green tea ice cream here my vegan version which us coconut milk in place of dairy,0
i’m so sorry for the unclear instruction yes the coconut milk get mixed with the rest of the ingredient and then poured into the ice cream maker hmm i’ve always found that 2 can of full fat coconut milk thickens up nicely it’s possible that there could be a difference in type of coconut milk or in ice cream maker i’ve used this template for lot of various ice cream i occasionally add corn starch but i’ve personally found the difference to be negligible the mixture need to be cool not hot before adding to the ice cream maker and the ice cream maker ha to be a frozen a possible i get a soft serve texture right out of the ice cream maker and then let it firm up in the freezer for a scoop-able texture i’ll be sure to test this one again adding more detailed note and i sincerely apologize for the trouble with the recipe,0
just tried to make this and it wa a total fail i wa suspicious of the ingredient list and should have trusted my instinct reading the last comment posted back in june 2016 i see that someone else had the same question a me about when to add the coconut milk because that is left out of the instruction while the flavor of the ingredient is great the ingredient do not make for good ice cream vegan ice cream need some sort of thickener i typically use arrowroot flour which is gluten free the mixture also need to be heated first to create the thickening and then cooled before putting into the ice creamer maker bowl this recipe never thickened in my ice cream maker and the fat in the coconut just separated from the liquid and hardened maybe this recipe ha potential with some tweak,0

this blog is almost always about making meal completely from scratch but it’s cold time like this that sometimes you just want to pour a box of mac and cheese into a pot and go to town well we did that posted a photo here on instagram and people went crazy for it so this barely qualifies a a recipe but our instagram ha spoken and who are we to deny the people what they want,0
3-4 cup cauliflower floret extra-virgin olive oil one bunch of kale stemmed about 5 packed cup a few squeeze of lemon a few squeeze of orange ¼ teaspoon dijon mustard salt & pepper ¼ cup hemp seed toasted chopped almond or pine nut crumbled feta cheese shaved parmesan cheese dried currant or cranberry chickpea or a protein of your choice roasted sweet potato roast w the cauliflower a scoop of hummus or cashew cream,1
preheat oven to 350 degree on a baking sheet lined with parchment toss the cauliflower with olive oil salt & pepper spread cauliflower evenly on the baking sheet and roast until golden brown usually 20-30 minute tear your kale into piece and place it all into a large bowl add a generous drizzle of olive oil and a bit of salt and pepper and use your hand to massage the leaf until the kale becomes tender and wilted the volume in your bowl will reduce by about half add a big squeeze of orange a big squeeze of lemon a bit of dijon mustard and use your hand to work it all together taste and adjust - if it bitter add orange if it bland add more seasoning what you add will depend on the bitterness of your kale i find that i add different amount each time if it still too raw-tasting let it sit for 20 or so minute at room temp and the flavor will develop a little more toss in the roasted cauliflower a sprinkle of hemp seed and some freshly cracked pepper if the kale is still too raw-tasting add some of the suggested add-on to offset the amount of kale in your salad store extra kale salad in an air tight container in the fridge it great for lunch the next day,2
this is a basic recipe that you can customize however you like – i like to serve it with soup or sometimes with a piece of salmon on top you can get creative with what you mix in – i often add a little feta cheese roasted sweet potato chickpea andor a scoop of hummus or cashew cream the option are endless,0

kale might be “so last year” but it’ll always have a special place in my heart,0
a piece of dried kombu about 2x3 inch 4 cup water 4 cup dashi 3 to 4 tablespoon white miso paste 1 teaspoon grated ginger ¼ cup chopped scallion ½ cup sliced shiitake mushroom 4 small turnip quartered ½ chopped carrot ½ cup firm tofu cube 4 ounce cooked soba noodle optional 1 cup chopped turnip green optional a few teaspoon soy sauce or tamari,1
make the dashi gently rinse the kombu piece place it in a medium pot with 4 cup water and gently simmer for 10 minute don’t let it boil or the kombu flavor will turn bitter once the kombu piece is soft remove it and bring the water to a boil for just a few minute reduce the heat again and add 1 cup more water in a small bowl stir the miso paste together with some of the hot dashi water until it’s not clumpy then stir to incorporate it into the soup broth add the ginger scallion and shiitake turnip and carrot and simmer on low until the turnip are soft and fork-tender about 35-40 minute note if your soup is too thick add 1-2 cup more water until it is a thinner consistency add the tofu and cooked soba noodle then taste and adjust seasoning adding a few teaspoon of soy sauce if you like store leftover soup in the fridge for 3 to 4 day,2
this soup sound and look amazing i can’t wait to try it out now that it’s coming back into soup season thanks for sharing 🍐,0
the first step in this miso soup recipe is making a homemade dashi stock this might sound fancy but it’s really simple just simmer your kombu in water for 10 minute being careful not to let it boil or the broth will become bitter after the kombu softens remove it and bring the dashi to a boil to get it hot enough to make a miso slurry,0
try my many-veggie soup lentil soup butternut squash soup or asparagus soup next,0
this soup sound and look amazing i can’t wait to try it out now that it’s coming back into soup season thanks for sharing 🍐,0
your recipe sound wonderful and i am going to make this but i would like to mention that when you simmer me so for 30 or 40 minute it doe alter the microbial bacteria it’s beneficial why not simmer it and then at the end add the diluted miso mixture,0

10 oz bag white chocolate chip i used these 1 teaspoon coconut oil about ½ cup almond butter optional ¼ - 1 teaspoon matcha stir in a much a you like to taste - i added quite a bit but i really really love the taste of matcha,1
over a double boiler on the stove or a saucepan filled with a few inch of gently boiling water with a glass bowl on top melt the chocolate and coconut oil together remove from heat scoop half of the white chocolate mixture into a second bowl and whisk in the matcha until smooth add a much matcha a you like - i like mine pretty matcha-ey prepare a mini muffin tin with paper liner add about 1 teaspoon of white chocolate into each cup swirling it a little to coat the bottom completely chill in the freezer until set about 20 minute tip if your almond butter is on the oily side pop it into the freezer to firm up and itll be easier to scoop into the little cup scoop about ½ teaspoon almond butter into each cup and cover each with remaining chocolate freeze until set about 20 more minute,2

i couldn’t find sweet harvest pumpkin tea in store and didn’t want to wait to order it online so i tried celestial seasoning’s bengal spice tea instead it doesn’t have the pumpkin or sweetener and is caffeine-free herbal instead of black tea but otherwise the ingredient are very similar it still turned out delicious and i think you could generally sub any chai spice tea if needed,0

hi can i substitute whole wheat pastry flour for the spelt flour,0
hi victoria i’m not sure because almond meal is so different than other flour i think another nut-meal would work – i make my own by blending almond pecan pistachio etc in the blender until it becomes a fine meal just don’t blend too much or it’ll turn into nut butter hope that help,0

hi nancy i don’t have a crockpot so i’m not sure what the setting are exactly – i would heat them until warmed through and then is there a warming setting to keep them warm until ready to serve they shouldn’t be runny if they’re dry at all the next day you can stir in a touch of water or a little more oil,0
2 ripe pear 3 tablespoon whole rolled oat 3 tablespoon chopped walnut 2 tablespoon gluten-free oat flour or almond meal 3 tablespoon brown sugar ¼ teaspoon cinnamon small grating of fresh nutmeg about ⅛ tsp pinch of salt 1½ tablespoon hardened coconut oil,1
preheat the oven to 375 in a small bowl mix together the oat flour walnut brown sugar cinnamon nutmeg and salt use your finger or the back of a fork to crumble in the hardened coconut oil until it incorporated but still crumbly grease the bottom of a 6 skillet or similar sized ramekin with coconut oil add the pear and sprinkle the crumble on top bake for about 20 minute or until the topping is golden brown and the pear are soft but not mushy serve warm or at room temperature with vanilla ice cream,2
i love to think of this pear crisp recipe a a “pair crisp” with quotation mark because this is a dessert for 2 get it jack is sitting next to me right now shaking his head but honestly i love dessert that are easy to make in small portion see if i made a pear crisp recipe large enough to serve 4 it would still serve just the two of u just one more bite after one more bite and it would all be over we have no control especially around sweet cinnamon-spiced fall dessert like this one and pssst if you’re serving 4 you can easily double this recipe,0
if you love apple crisp a much a i do i’m telling you you have to try it with pear they’re so soft and sweet that they practically melt into the crumble topping and because ripe pear are so much softer than apple this pear crisp recipe bakes in about half the time what’s not to love about that,0
the photo look like it ha dried cranberry in it or am i just imagining it if it doesn’t can i add some look yummy,0

12 ounce brussels sprout about 2 cup shredded 1 apple very thinly sliced 2 kohlrabi stem removed sliced into matchstick ¼ cup dried cranberry or currant ¼ cup toasted pine nut a good drizzle of olive oil about 2 tablespoon squeeze of ½ a lemon salt & pepper very optional grated pecorino or crumbled feta cheese,1
clean brussels sprout by wiping them with a damp towel then removing the top leaf that are dirty you want your brussels sprout to be very dry so the salad doesnt become too watery get out your mandoline if you have one slice the brussels sprout into thin shred then slice the apple peel any rough part off of the kohlrabi skin thinly slice the kohlrabi bulb into plank then use a knife to slice the plank into little matchstick place cut veggie into a bowl and add cranberry pine nut and a few pinch of salt toss well then add olive oil and a good squeeze of lemon and toss again taste and adjust seasoning let the salad sit for about 10 minute at room temp then serve add some cheese if you like,2

i’m also a sucker for alliteration – so the 3 b’s in butternut burrito bowl had a nice ring to it although i actually have 4 b’s in here if you count the brown rice btw if anyone from chipotle is reading this brown rice just sayin’,0

1 medium sugar pumpkin or 1 butternut squash see note 1 small apple or ½ a large one 1 medium yellow onion drizzle of olive oil salt pepper for roasting 3 clove of garlic 1 can coconut milk 1 teaspoon fresh grated ginger ¼ - ½ teaspoon ground cardamom ¼ teaspoon cayenne more to taste 1 teaspoon additional salt more to taste,1
preheat oven to 400 degree f roast pumpkin or butternut squash i start by putting mine in the oven for a few minute to soften so it easier to cut cut in half and scoop out the inside save & toast the seed if you want drizzle with olive oil salt and pepper and roast cut side up for 20 minute flip and roast cut side down for 20-30 or until the flesh is soft remove from oven let cool then peel the skin away from the flesh while the squash roast slice the apple and onion into wedge and arrange on a baking sheet drizzle with olive oil salt and pepper and roast for 20 minute or until the edge turn golden brown during the last 10 minute or so add the whole garlic clove to the baking sheet in a blender add pumpkin mash roasted onion apple garlic remove the skin coconut milk ginger cardamom cayenne and salt puree until smooth if it too thick add a bit of water or broth to thin and blend again taste and adjust seasoning store leftover in the fridge for up to a few day,2
this recipe come together pretty easily and it doesn’t even require a pot i roasted the pumpkin an apple an onion and a few garlic clove all in the oven i put it all in a blender and pureéd it into a creamy soup with coconut milk ginger and the special ingredient – cardamom if you don’t have it you can sub in some curry powder but cardamom the hardest spice to describe ha a spicy-sweet sort of floral flavor that work really well here to create a nice balance with the sweet apple and savory roasted pumpkin,0
it’s only october 1st and yet i feel like i’m already the last to post a pumpkin recipe this time of year pinterest is crazy for pumpkin but don’t worry – if you’re too cool for pumpkin you can just a easily make this soup with butternut squash,0

we have a new superfood obsession – we’re head over heel in love with tart cherry it started with this froyo recipe but since then i’ve been tossing frozen tart cherry into our morning smoothy and mixing tart cherry juice into cocktail among other simple uses…,0
it’s an understatement to say that jack and i both drink a lot of iced tea while i usually prefer unsweetened tea – i’ve found that adding just a splash of tart cherry juice to plain black tea or green tea is so deliciously tangy and refreshing… and just slightly sweet which is the way i like my tea this is quick and easy make – it ha just two ingredient plus some mint and a few lemon slice lime or orange slice would be lovely in here a well,0

3 pound ripe peach 1½ cup sugar 1 cup lightly sweet white wine i used a viognier 7 dried pequin chile pepper stem removed 3 granny smith apple or pectin ¼ cup lemon juice zest from 1 small lemon about 1 tablespoon,1
peel cut a small x into the bottom of each peach drop it into boiling water for a minute or two youll know when it ready when you see the skin start to separate near the x remove and then drop into an ice bath once the peach is cool enough to handle slip the skin off ive also found that the ease of removing peach skin really depends on the ripeness of the fruit and how it been grown if the peach is overripe or underripe it always seems like it much harder sometimes impossible to remove the skin in that case i just cut the skin away cut and mix add a little sugar into the bottom of a medium-sized glass or non-metal non-reactive bowl slice each peach in half top to bottom and remove the pit cut each half into 12-16 thin slice and add to the bowl between each peach add a little more sugar until youve added all the peach and all the sugar then add the wine and the chile and stir gently until combined macerate 2-3 day let the mixture sit in the fridge for at least two day and up to three if you want a little extra kick try this on the second day simmer the mixture again allow to cool and transfer back to the bowl and let it sit in the fridge for one more day this will infuse more spice into your jam cook if youre canning start preparing your boiling water bath jar and lid now pour the peach mixture into a colander suspended over a bowl and strain the juice transfer the juice to a preserving pan or a heavy-bottomed wide deep non-reactive uncoated sauté pan add the lemon juice to the pan cut the apple into quarter and either add straight to the pan or bundle in a cheesecloth and add to the pan you can substitute the apple with homemade or commercial pectin if youd prefer bring the mixture to a boil over high heat continue to boil stirring from time to time until the liquid is bubbling thickly and reduced about 15-20 minute remove the apple and discard or save for another use add the peach slice lemon zest and any accumulated juice to the syrup in the pan bring to a simmer and cook over medium-high heat stirring frequently until the mixture is bubbling thickly and the foam subsides about 15-20 minute remove from heat and stir gently for a few second to distribute the fruit can optional fill your hot sterile jar to ¼ headspace remove any air bubble wipe the rim put your lid on and process for 10 minute in the boiling water bath store refrigerated the preserve will keep up to 1 month canned theyll keep in a cool dark spot for up to 1 year,2

2 cup whole milk greek yogurt 1 can full fat coconut milk refrigerate & scoop the solid part ⅔ cup cane sugar ¼ cup maple syrup 1 teaspoon vanilla 1 teaspoon sea salt ¾ cup tart cherry or raspberry thawed if frozen extra tart cherry toasted sliced almond,1
in a large bowl whisk together the yogurt coconut milk solid see note below sugar maple syrup vanilla and salt whisk until well combined then pour the mix into an ice cream maker and follow the manufacturer direction use a fork or a potato masher to gently break up the tart cherry add them to the ice cream maker toward the end of the churning time so they swirl throughout scoop & enjoy andor pour it into a container and freeze it for 30 minute to firm it up,2

i love sour cherry and they’re especially good mixed into the tart frozen yogurt if you can’t find tart or sour cherry in your grocers’ freezer section you can make a request for your store to start carrying them i do this all the time otherwise swap your favorite frozen fruit into this recipe raspberry would be an especially good substitute,0
we’ve made a lot of ice cream before so i don’t know why it’s taken u this long to think of making a frozen yogurt recipe with actual yogurt,0

first de-seed your watermelon then add the watermelon flesh into a blender take the rind and squeeze out a much remaining juice a you can blend until smooth then strain the juice through a fine mesh strainer or skip this step and start with some good cold-pressed watermelon juice to your watermelon juice add a few sqeezes of lemon or lime pour watermelon juice into glass with ice then stir in st germain and vodka to taste st germain is sweet so depending on the sweetness of your watermelon you may want to add more or le of it for more tartness add more lemon for more booziness add more vodka,2
this is definitely a simplified version but i get impatient to make cocktail that have more than just a few easy ingredient the hardest part here is de-seeding your watermelon and blending it into juice the second time i made these i got lazy and just bought some cold-pressed watermelon juice,0
i had been thinking of making watermelon margarita until i had the most refreshing elderflower & vodka watermelon cocktail made by the tipsy texan a few week ago at the opening of métier cook’s supply a really cute kitchen supply store btw – if you’re in austin go check it out,0
in case i haven’t mentioned it before – it’s pretty hot here i’ve been eating watermelon like crazy because well i think it just might be the most refreshing fruit on the planet,0

2 cup pamelas pizza crust mix yeast is included in the mix 1 cup plus 2 tablespoon warm water 2 tablespoon olive oil ¼ cup gluten free cornmeal olive oil to brush on the crust ⅔ cup ricotta 1 cup sliced fig a few dollop of pesto a handful of arugula 2 tablespoon pistachio toasted & crushed drizzle of honey optional drizzle of balsamic vinegar,1
preheat oven to 475 mix the pizza dough according to package direction use a little cornmeal to help form the dough into about 2 10-inch pizza since the dough is sticky we put it between 2 piece of parchment and rolled the crust out with a rolling pin partially bake them on parchment for 8-10 minute or until theyre cooked in the middle and cohesive enough to lift off in one piece brush with olive oil and grill for 1-2 minute on each side top grilled flatbread with ricotta sliced fig a few dollop of pesto arugula pistachio honey and balsamic vinegar or balsamic reduction optional step make a balsamic reduction by simmering vinegar over low heat in a small saucepan stir frequently until it evaporated into about half the amount you started with,2
i love this the flavour harmonise perfectly together,0
i knew pamela’s pizza crust would be good like i mentioned before all of my gluten friend swear by their flour but even jack wa surprised how gluten-full it tasted the dough is very sticky to work with you won’t be tossing it into the air we carefully formed it partially baked it and then grilled it the edge wa crispy the middle wa chewy… you’d never know this crust wa made with brown rice and other whole grain,0
thank you jill i’m glad you’ve been enjoying so many recipe 🙂,0
this look amazing i recently went gluten free and one of the thing i miss the most is pizza i did try a pizza mix i think it wa pamela’s a few month ago and it wa surprisingly good,0

i first made this orzo salad recipe at my mom’s house when i dug through her fridge i found crunchy veggie summer herb and a big juicy mango that i absolutely had to use i caught sight of a box of orzo pasta and a can of chickpea in her pantry and i immediately thought – orzo salad it would be hearty enough to serve for dinner but light and refreshing for the heat wave that wa happening that night i tossed together crunchy cucumber red onion fresh herb and mango and dished it up for my family while we ate they kept asking for this orzo salad recipe well here it is,0

made this for lunch today a my body wa craving something healthy i could not find whole wheat orzo so i used regular i used frozen mango chunk a the mango in the market were rock hard well that wa much easier i roasted the chick pea and used basil instead of cilantro since the plant in my backyard wa coming to an end i used white wine vinegar in the dressing instead of sherry absolutely delicious and beautiful to look at thank you for the inspiration,0

i used this julienne peeler for the zucchini strip,0
hi… wa wondering what you use to julienne everything so beautifully thanks,0
a the temp have been rising i’ve been craving food that’s lighter and colder lately we’ve spent most evening dining al fresco trying to live it up before the 100 degree weather set in chill evening call for chilled food and these lettuce wrap are just so refreshing… a beautiful appetizer or in our case a light dinner,0
1 cup organic popcorn coffee grinder or high speed blender ½ cup corn flour 2 cup water ½ teaspoon garlic powder ¼ teaspoon sea salt 1 zucchini diced small ¼ cup red onion diced ½ of a serrano pepper diced 1 cup cherry tomato sliced 1 tablespoon olive oil zest & juice of 1 lime more a needed 1 teaspoon white wine vinegar handful of chopped cilantro salt & pepper diced avocado optional - a few handful of arugula for serving,1
grind the popcorn in a coffee grinder or high speed blender such a a vitamix sift to remove the hard piece from the soft flour don’t skip this step or you’ll have crunchy polenta make the polenta in a medium saucepan bring the corn flour water garlic powder and salt to a boil cook stirring frequently until mixture thickens to a creamy consistency 3 to 4 minute spoon the mixture into an oiled 8x8 inch pan let the polenta cool completely i made mine a few hour in advance and let it chill in the fridge to set make the salsa mix all ingredient together except for the avocado chill for at least 2-3 hour so the raw zucchini can marinate in the lime juice and seasoning remove from fridge add diced avocado then taste and adjust seasoning add more salt pepper andor lime juice to taste if it too tart add a pinch of sugar or see erin roasted salsa recipe below when ready to grill the polenta slice in to 2-inch square and brush each side with olive oil place on a preheated grill i suggest using a grill pan since these are delicate cook each side until browned 4-6 or more minute depending on the heat of your grill or in my case pan serve with salsa optional - i served mine on top of a few handful of arugula,2
grinding note i used this cheap coffee grinder for small batch it did a pretty job – the flour wa soft and fluffy – although i sifted out a good amount of harder kernel piece that wouldn’t grind although popcorn is cheap and so wa the coffee grinder i think this is great for the occasional use although i could tell the motor wa getting warm i paused every few second to let it cool so i’m not sure how long it would last with this kind of use,0

1 tablespoon maple syrup ½ package 12 tablespoon active dry yeast ¾ cup water 14 cup for proofing ½ cup for dough 2 tablespoon olive oil or canola oil 2 cup all-purpose flour 1 teaspoon sea salt 2 tablespoon baking soda this is for the boiling water not the dough 6 cup water in a pot for boiling coarse salt for sprinkling,1
proof the yeast put ¼ cup warm water maple syrup and yeast into a small cup and stir until yeast dissolve if yeast doe not foam try again with another yeast packet make the dough if you have a mixer with a dough hook put the flour salt oil proofed yeast mixture and an additional ½ cup of water for a total of ¾ cup water into the mixer run on medium low for about 5-6 minute until the dough pull away from the bowl if you don’t have a dough hook mix and knead dough ingredient for about 8-10 minute brush the inside of a large glass bowl with a little bit of oil form the dough into a ball and put it in the bowl cover and allow the dough to rise for about 40 minute or until it ha doubled in size preheat your oven to 450 degree f uncover your dough and punch it down few time really let it have it prepare a cookie sheet with parchment paper on it set aside prepare an oiled work surface cut the dough into 4 or 6 equal section depending on the size you want your pretzel and roll each out to an approx 18-24 inch long rope grab the end of each dough rope to make a u shape then form into a pretzel shape put 6 cup of water into a pot and dissolve the 2 tablespoon of baking soda into the water and bring to a rolling boil drop pretzel one at a time into the pot get close so it doesn’t splash each should sink a little then rise up wait 30 second then lift out using a slotted spoon and place each onto the cookie sheet while still wet sprinkle liberally with coarse salt take a sharp knife and cut a 4-6 inch slit along the bottom of the pretzel this slit will open up during baking bake for about 14 minute watch them like a hawk – when they’re golden brown they’re done,2
can you make this recipe with sourdough starter rather than active dry yeast if so how would you adjust the recipe,0
love the recipe but i found it difficult to follow,0
do you know if you would be able to boil then freeze these before baking them i am looking for a good recipe for our brewery for the occasional vegan request and would love to have some on hand to just throw in the oven and bake to order,0
these pretzel are wonderful and simple because you’re essentially making fairly standard dough using baking soda and boiling water to smooth out the outside then baking it that’s really about it the hardest part probably is twirling the pretzel my main modification from laugenbrezel are to use maple syrup instead of barley malt syrup oil instead of butter and baking soda instead of severe burn and lawsuit lye,0
such a good recipe first time attempting to make soft pretzel and they turned out excellent,0

i recently contributed this dukkah recipe to food 52’s small batch series when they first suggested it i had to look up how to authentically make it it turn out — there’s no one way the word dukkah literally mean “to pound” and it generally consists of hazelnut sesame seed and a few whole dried spice to me this wa the perfect opportunity to use up the nut and spice i had just cleaned out of my pantry shelf specifically the one that didn’t fit when i transferred them from little bag to little jar,0

oh and this sauce it’s along the same line a some of the cashew-based sauce i’ve made but it’s also somehow entirely different the almond and almond milk create a light creamy homemade mayo-ish texture the mustard give it tang don’t be shy with the mustard i added turmeric initially just for color but i think it’s the secret ingredient that really make this special,0
a note about the blanched almond – i wa lucky enough to find already-peeled one at central market here in austin if you can’t find them get regular raw almond and follow the note below it’s a little tedious and i definitely recommend delegating that task to your significant other,0
i don’t live in the mid-west but on particularly golden sunny day i love it 😀 you always post such beautiful food post,0

1 cup finely chopped carrot green 2 teaspoon dried oregano 14 teaspoon cumin 1 teaspoon sweet paprika 12 teaspoon red pepper flake 1 garlic clove minced 12 teaspoon sea salt freshly ground black pepper 14 cup white wine vinegar 14 cup extra-virgin olive oil,1
in a small bowl combine the carrot green oregano cumin paprika red pepper flake garlic salt and pepper stir in the vinegar and olive oil taste and adjust seasoning,2
is it possible to freeze this sauce i have a ton of carrot top and trying to save a much a possible i’d love to make and freeze this for over the winter month 🙂,0
i made a second batch of this the instant i tasted the first however i used a little le oil and substituted lemon juice for vinegar to die for,0
this wa delicious i substituted red wine vinegar because it wa all i had on hand and added an extra garlic clove because we love garlic and it still came out incredible our kid devoured it definitely making again thank you for this delicious recipe,0
before we get to the sauce let’s talk carrot top they have a lightly sweet earthy flavor that’s like a cross between carrot and parsley and they’re delicious raw or cooked this recipe us most of the top from one small bunch of carrot or half the top from a large bunch that mean you’ll have leftover aside from this chimichurri sauce here are a few of my favorite way to use carrot green,0
this recipe is a slight spin on hers i used carrot green instead of the traditional parsley and i added le water and oil to make a thicker dip-able sauce it’s not at all authentic but it’s delicious nonetheless,0
15 cup of full fat coconut milk 1 can 15 tablespoon corn starch or tapioca starch ⅓ cup sugar zest and juice of 1 small meyer lemon ⅛ teaspoon salt optional - crushed vanilla wafer,1
in a small bowl mix ¼ cup of the coconut milk with the corn starch and whisk until it fully dissolved add the remaining coconut milk sugar lemon zest lemon juice and salt whisk again pour into the bowl of your ice cream maker and follow the manufacturer direction to finish the ice cream serve with crushed vanilla wafer or topping of your choice,2
hi terry 1 meyer lemon is about 14 cup of juice,0
i even used the cooked & chilled custard to eat with fresh mango and chopped walnut for breakfast similar to yogurt and fresh fruit this is a delicious recipe that i will make over and over again,0
this is a pretty simple recipe from here you can get a fancy a you like with whatever you like some good choice are mint vanilla bean or my personal favorite— a teeny pinch of cayenne to make it just a little spicy,0
it’s probably about time for a truly lemony post here on love and lemon pucker up this sweet & sour ice cream is the perfect way in my opinion to welcome spring or to dream about spring if it hasn’t quite reached you yet,0
yes an ice cream maker is required here — i’m not going to lie it take up an annoying amount of space but we really do use ours quite often it’s fun to get creative with flavor combination you can’t just buy in a store especially non-dairy combination i imagine making ice cream would be a fun project for kid not that we have kid but whenever i tell jack “we’re making ice cream tonight” his eye light up like a five year old he go to town measuring & mixing… i sit back and watch it’s pretty great,0
heaping ½ cup pistachio chopped & toasted a few big handful of pea tendril or any mild soft leafy green zest & juice of 1 small lemon 1 small garlic clove salt & pepper olive oil a few tablespoon to ¼ cup optional handful of fresh basil or mint optional grated parmesan cheese,1
in a food processor pulse together everything except for the olive oil drizzle the oil in slowly while the blade is running add a much or little olive oil a you want le oil will make a chunkier pesto more olive oil will make it more smooth taste and adjust seasoning,2
i forgot to rate the recipe-5 star for sure,0
pea tendril have a mild flavor that’s slightly sweet which make for nice mellow pesto if you can’t find them you can still make a nice pistachio pesto out of spinach arugula basil or mint… whatever combination of soft green and herb you like this last in the fridge for about 3 day – i put it on toast mixed it into pasta and added it to a few lunchtime kale salad pesto possibility are endless,0
thanks sini i did a pea tendril risotto also with this batch – so delicious,0
i made this tonight after wondering what to do with all of the pea tendril i had this wa amazing i added it to chickpea pasta along with cherry tomato and basil so good can’t wait to use it a a dip for cracker or veggie too thank you,0
hi ginger i’m so glad you enjoyed it,0

parsnip extra-virgin olive oil sea salt ketchup andor mayo,1
preheat your oven to 375f scrub your parsnip clean and lightly peel them you dont have to peel them if yours are really clean slice into thin strip toss with a drizzle of olive oil and a few good pinch of salt bake 15-25 minute or until golden brown flipping halfway remove from oven and serve immediately these are best hot,2
not only are these parsnip fry healthier than traditional fry they have much more fiber but they have a unique flavor if you’ve cooked with parsnip before you know that they’re slightly sweet a a result these crispy fry have a fantastic sweet & salty taste that make them totally addictive,0
i think for this i’d go for fry sauce- ketchup plus mayo look delicious,0
what i’m not sorry about are these parsnip fry – they’re awesome and super simple to make i recommend making extra because you or your significant other – i’m not naming any name here will likely eat most of them right off the baking sheet and you’re going to want a few left to enjoy with your burger,0
i think for this i’d go for fry sauce- ketchup plus mayo look delicious,0

1 tablespoon ground flax 3 tablespoon water 2 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil 1 medium shallot chopped 13 cup 2 garlic clove chopped 2 teaspoon ground cumin 2 teaspoon ground coriander pinch of cayenne 1 tablespoon vegan worcestershire or soy sauce or tamari 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 1 tablespoon tomato paste or ketchup 1 tablespoon grated beet optional for color 14 cup walnut 1 cup cooked black bean divided 34 cup cooked red quinoa,1
preheat oven to 375 with a metal baking sheet inside in a small bowl stir the flax & water together and set aside heat the oil in a medium skillet add the shallot garlic and pinch of salt and pepper and cook for a few minute until translucent add the cumin and coriander stir and cook for 30 second more add the worcestershire balsamic tomato paste grated beet walnut and the first 12 cup black bean and 12 teaspoon salt stir and cook for another few minute and turn heat off let cool slightly then add the content from the pan to the food processor add the flax egg and pulse until everything is combined but not pureed transfer the mixture to a bowl and stir in the remaining 12 cup of black bean smash them a little a you stir and 12 cup of the quinoa you can taste & adjust seasoning at this point stir until this is all very cohesive then divide into 4 segment and roll into ball place the 4 ball on a plate and sprinkle them with the remaining 14 cup quinoa gently roll them so the quinoa coat the outside of the ball then press each in the palm of your hand to form patty place on parchment paper on a plate and chill for 20 minute transfer the parchment w your patty onto the pre-heated baking sheet drizzle a little olive oil on top and bake for about 15 minute flip and bake for an additional 10-12 minute until the outside is not mushy let cool slightly and serve with desired fixing,2
i’m not sure where to begin with this quinoa burger recipe it ha a wonderful meaty texture with lightly crisp edge a spicy tangy flavor and a gorgeous red color plus it’s totally vegan and gluten-free what’s not to love,0
hi den i’m so glad you’ve been enjoying the recipe i think these modification should work – it’s hard to say if they’ll hold together the same way without trying myself,0

4 tablespoon coconut oil hardened 1 cup flour whole wheat spelt or gf oat flour 1 cup walnut ½ cup brown sugar 1 teaspoon cinnamon ¼ teaspoon salt ⅓ cup or so raspberry jam,1
preheat oven to 350 and prepare a 5x7 baking dish or equivalent size with parchment paper in a food processor pulse together the coconut oil flour walnut brown sugar cinnamon and salt until it’s crumbly like wet sand take ¾ of the crumbly mix and press it into the bottom of the pan bake the bottom crust for 10-15 minute or until the edge turn lightly golden brown remove from the oven and let cool if necessary - add a tiny bit of water to the remaining crumbly mix which will be your topping and mix it gently with your hand so it form thicker crumbles when your crust is cool to the touch spread a layer of raspberry jam and crumble on the topping bake for an additional 10-12 minute let cool carefully lift out parchment and slice,2
look delicious we didn’t have walnut so we used pecan instead we also combined strawberry jam fresh raspberry and orange zest to make the filling a well a added nutmeg and orange zest to the crumble the result were incredible,0
yum i just made these they’re delicious and wish i’d made a double batch i did however have to use considerably more coconut oil than the recipe called for to get the “wet sand” consistency any idea why i also added some frozen berry to the jam just for a bit of freshness and heated it together with a little cornstarch and let it cool before topping the baked base with the mixture i understand why you indicate “13 cup or so” in the method – i’d go for more “or so” next time bumping up the jammy amount thanks so much jeanine for yet another outstanding recipe,0

others have already mentioned this but it seemed like 12 c of tofu wa too small of an amount when combined with the 1 12 c of cashew cream i used the whole block of tofu with the cashew cream and adjusted the spice to taste i felt like the consistency wa more ‘ricotta’ like with that adjustment,0

i love chilaquiles alot esp for brunch i have found that corn tortilla can be broiled for few minute in the oven to get the crisp texture although you need to be little bit more careful,0
today’s recipe is something i really love to make at home because it tends to be a little too greasy for me at restaurant chilaquiles are usually considered hangover food and it all start with frying tortilla in a skillet of course i went a little a lot lighter on the oil so they toast in the skillet and crisp up without becoming an oily mess this way we reserve a few extra calorie for that brunch-time margarita,0
what a great recipe substituted the fried egg with a poached one to make it a bit healthier and some black bean and tomato salad it wa truly delicious 🙂,0

i’m pretty sure this one cover all of my major food group green vegetable avocado almond mint lime & sriracha in fact i could probably stop right here and live happily ever after i could change our name to the brussels sprout blog and take picture of this dish – every day – just in a different bowl you know to keep thing exciting,0
don’t tell him 🙂 my wife can’t stand the word anchovy to begin with but i use them often in sauce for some of her now favorite mediterranean dishes… i’ve often experienced that people have preconceived idea about a certain flavor for this recipe i’d add generous squeeze of lime when serving to subdue the fish sauce to a background flavor,0

10 sage leaf 2 cup spiraled butternut squash about ¼ of a large one 1½ cup leek white and light green part 4 ounce brown rice pasta canola grapeseed or other high-heat oil 2 garlic clove juice of 1 lemon 1 tablespoon butter or vegan earth balance ¼ cup walnut chopped and toasted a few pinch of red chile flake sea salt and fresh black pepper grated pecorino cheese or crumbly cheese drizzle of balsamic or reduced balsamic,1
first fry the sage in a large skillet add enough oil to well coat the bottom once the oil is hot and shimmering test-fry 1 sage leaf in a few second it should turn deeper green remove and drain on a paper towel it should become crispy a it dry if it burn turn your heat down and test another i put 10 leaf in the recipe so you can mess up a few once your oil is at the right temp fry them all drain and set aside turn off the heat and let the pan cool for a few minute then pour out excess oil leaving just enough to continue to cook with boil pasta in salty water for 8 minute or until al-dente in the last 2 minute add the butternut squash spiral meanwhile turn your large skillet back up to medium heat add the leek and a few pinch of salt & pepper cook until soft and translucent then add the minced garlic when your pasta & butternut noodle are ready drain and add them to the skillet reserving ¼ to ½ cup of the starchy pasta water for later add a few squeeze of lemon a pat of butter and a few good pinch of salt pepper and red chile flake toss everything together to coat add pasta water ¼ cup at a time if necessary to loosen the pasta once the butternut noodle are tender but still have a firm bite turn the heat off you dont want mushy butternut squash taste and adjust seasoning then transfer the pasta to a serving platter or bowl top with chopped walnut and fried sage leaf serve with grated pecorino andor balsamic vinegar if you like,2
the squash is little bit more difficult to get through than a cucumber but it wa easy once i figured out this little trick slice your squash lengthwise in half scrape out the seed and then slice the half lengthwise again into 5 or 6 thinner wedge-shaped strip that are closer in width to your peeler an inch and a half or so push your julienne peeler over each wedge and voilà… butternut squash noodles… and a bonus arm workout,0

1 heaping cup chopped kale stem 3 clove of garlic ½ cup toasted walnut or pine nut big handful of parsley andor basil juice & zest of 1 lemon salt & pepper pinch of red pepper flake ¼ cup olive oil optional - drizzle of balsamic vinegar optional - grated parmesan or pecorino cheese,1

japanese or chinese eggplant a little bit of olive oil chopped scallion sesame seed ¼ cup white or yellow miso paste ¼ cup mirin ¼ cup organic cane sugar sometimes i use a bit le,1
preheat your oven to 350 degree slice your eggplant in half arrange on a baking sheet and gently score the surface of the flesh brush with a little bit of olive oil and pre-bake your eggplant for a few minute until the flesh start to become tender 8 mintues or so depending on the size of your eggplant remove eggplant from the oven and turn your oven temp to broil meanwhile make the glaze in a small saucepan combine the miso mirin and sugar and bring to a gentle simmer whisk continuously until the sugar ha dissolved and the glaze start to thicken 2 minute or so - barely bubbling remove from heat and let it cool and continue to thicken for a few minute note - if you taste it at this point itll seem very salty - it will sweeten once the sugar caramelize on the eggplant under the broiler liberally brush the glaze onto the eggplant broil until brown & bubbling about 5-8 minute the amount of time will vary depending on the size of your eggplant and the strength of your broiler check after about 3 minute remove from the oven and garnish with chopped scallion and sesame seed if your eggplant are larger with tougher skin scoop and eat just the flesh these pictured were tiny and tender enough to eat with the skin,2
i like this version – it’s 14 cup of just 3 ingredient miso mirin japanese sweet cooking wine & sugar it’s easy to remember without having to refer back to a recipe and you can alter it however you like from there,0

this is a bit of a twist on a spanish style gazpacho i make it numerous way always drawing on the memory of the one i had on this day sometimes i switch up the pepper sometimes i make it raw sometimes i add a few spice but i particularly love the subtle smoky flavor that happens when the ingredient are first charred on a dry skillet not to mention it’s a nice fix for less-than-amazing tomato,0
this recipe will be in my permanent file because it is versatile and i will it make a many time a possible while my garden tomato are producing,0

pulse all ingredient in a food processor then drizzle in the olive oil while continuing to run the food processor taste and adjust seasoning tip this is bold in flavor on it own so i suggest tasting it with a bit of whatever youre going to be serving it with before adjusting spoon on top of fish meat or veggie chop and blanch the kale in salted boiling water for about 30 second drain see note place the kale in a medium bowl and mix in the feta cheese garlic scallion dried oregano salt and pepper your filling should stick together if it crumbly add some warm water a little at a time taste and adjust seasoning to assemble place 2 sheet of filo on your work surface brush it with melted butter and slice it into 5 vertical strip place a teaspoon of filling at the bottom of each strip and roll it up flag-style repeat the process until you run out of filling youll have around 15 triangle brush the outside with butter and bake in a 425-degree oven for 20 minute or until golden toss kale with olive oil and salt and bake in a 400 degree oven until crispy but not completely charred 6-8 minute or so check often you may need to rotate it halfway chop and set aside toss rice with just a bit of rice vineger and a pinch of sugar place the rice in bowl and assemble your topping mix soy sauce with a bit of rice vinegar and sesame oil and serve in little bowl on the side heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-low heat add the shallot a pinch of salt and cook until transluscent about 2 minute add the garlic paprika and saffron stir and cook until just aromatic about 30 second being careful not to let it burn add the chickpea and a bit more salt stir to incorporate turn the heat of the burner up a bit and let the chickpea cook until they begin to turn golden brown stirring occasionally add the sherry vinegar and tomato paste then the kale continue to cook for a few minute until the kale is just wilted remove from the heat taste and adjust the seasoning adding a little lemon juice if necessary preheat oven to 375 degree in an individually sized baking dish mix the tomato with paprika salt & pepper and layer it on the bottom in a separate small bowl toss kale with a little olive oil balsamic salt and pepper place the kale in the baking dish on top of the tomato top with feta cheese and chopped scallion crack 1-2 egg into the dish and bake until set about 10-12 minute or fry the egg separately and place on top finish with some freshly cracked black pepper,2
hmm… i would probably put it in a bowl loosely cover it and leave it out at room temp of all the part to make ahead of time the rice would be most convenient since it take the longest the kale is really quick at the end,0

this is the easiest vegan french toast recipe i have encountered my daughter love it thank you,0
coconut flour is the most hydrophilic flour i’ve ever used you may need to halve the amount given in the recipe to prevent the batter turning into sludge,0
this one is close or maybe better even jack wa surprised it didn’t have egg i used vanilla almond breeze almond milk millet flour nutritional yeast which seems strange but it give it that eggy essence cinnamon nutmeg and lot of maple syrup i loved it with chewy ciabatta bread but this vegan french toast would also be gluten-free if you sub in gluten-free bread,0
coconut flour is the most hydrophilic flour i’ve ever used you may need to halve the amount given in the recipe to prevent the batter turning into sludge,0

8 slice of brioche bread thats a little bit stale 4 tablespoon or so of nutella 3 egg ⅓ cup milk i used almond milk a little bit of butter for the pan powdered sugar for dusting,1
spread nutella in the center of 4 of the piece of bread and assemble each like a sandwich dont spread it all the way to the edge so that the edge of the bread will adhere together later with the egg mixture in a shallow baking dish with side whisk the egg and the milk together dip each sandwich into the egg mixture and flip it over a few time to saturate the bread heat butter in a large skillet over high heat cook each piece until golden brown on both side a minute or 2 dust with powdered sugar and serve,2
just came across this recipe and it is delightful thanks for sharing,0

preheat your oven to 400 degree meanwhile bring a large pot of salted water to boil boil 3 cup of the cauliflower floret until tender about 10-20 minute while the cauliflower is boiling start roasting the rest of the cauliflower and the chickpea prep 2 baking sheet with foil separately toss the chickpea and cauliflower with olive oil garlic rosemary salt & pepper i do this right on the baking sheet roast both in the oven until golden brown about 25-35 minute checking halfway through make the cauliflower puree drain the boiled cauliflower and transfer to a high speed blender add the garlic butter ½ cup chickpea rosemary lemon juice salt and pepper and blend to form a smooth puree taste and adjust adding more salt pepper andor lemon a necessary if yours is too thick add some water or milk if it too thin add some more chickpea the consistency should be thinner and lighter than hummus note that i used a vitamix if youre using a regular blender yours might not be a smooth plate with a generous scoop of the puree and top it with the roasted cauliflower chickpea a drizzle of olive oil caper a few small pinch of red pepper flake and another pinch of rosemary and an extra squeeze of lemon if necessary,2
maybe i’m the black sheep here but blending raw garlic into the puree made it quite spicy so much that it wa unpleasant to eat did anyone else experience this if i were to do it again i would fry the garlic first before adding it to the puree however i still like the idea of cauliflower puree with roasted chickpea,0

1 cup all-purpose flour 1 cup millet flour or all-purpose is fine too ½ teaspoon salt only if using unsalted butter ¾ cup powdered sugar or granulated sugar 1 cup vegan butter room temperature i used vegan earth balance next time i will try coconut oil 1 teaspoon almond extract optional topping – pistachio pine nut dried fruit etc,1
preheat the oven to 325 degree sift together the flour sugar and salt if using in a medium bowl use a wooden spoon to mix the butter and almond extract together add the dry ingredient and mix everything together use your hand if necessary to incorporate the butter and get the dough to come together your dough will be pretty crumbly stop when it ha just come together don’t overmix form it into a ball for cutout cooky roll onto a nonstick baking sheet i rolled pine nut into the top of my dough until your dough is about ¼ inch thick if the dough is sticky and you’re having a hard time put it in the fridge for a little bit so the butter in the dough stiffens up bake for about 20 minute until the dough start to turn golden brown remove and let cool almost completely before you cut out your shape you’ll have a lot of “scraps” with this method and will yield le finished cooky for square shortbread press dough into an edged baking pan along with any topping you like i made a half recipe and used a 5×7 pan my cooky were a about ½ inch thick since they were on the thick side i baked these for about 30-35 minute until they started turning golden brown on top the time will vary depending on the thickness so just watch them once they’re done let cool and then slice,2

i love them too they’re new at west elm httpwwwwestelmcomproductsmrk-copper-measuring-cups-d453,0
here wa my summer version i guess i could have linked that above httpwwwloveandlemonscom20120713grilled-panzanella-poached-egg,0
that look like my idea of delicious i’m not sure i’ve ever mad the “original” version of panzanella before…somewhere there’s a recipe for a “spring panzanella” with white bean leek asparagus sun dried tom crispy ciabatta and pesto which i love though,0
2-3 tablespoon coconut oil 1 large onion coarsely chopped 4 garlic clove i add them whole the blender will do the work later 3 lime leaf or a bit of lemongrass or omit 2 tablespoon red curry paste 1-2 teaspoon grated ginger 3½ cup roasted pumpkin or butternut squash skin and seed removed 1 can coconut milk light or full fat either is fine 4 cup veggie broth maple syrup for drizzling pinch cayenne sea salt and fresh black pepper sauteed kale or other green optional,1
in a large pot over medium heat heat the coconut oil add the onion and sprinkle with salt and pepper cook until soft and translucent 5 to 7 minute add the garlic clove lime leaf curry paste and ginger cook until fragrant about 2-3 more minute add the roasted pumpkin and mix everything together let the pumpkin cook a few more minute breaking apart the larger piece with your wooden spoon or spatula before thing start sticking to the bottom of your pot add the coconut milk and the veggie broth add the maple syrup and a pinch of cayenne pepper cover and simmer for 20-25 minute stirring occasionally remove the lime leaf and pour the soup into a high speed blender you may have to work in batch and puree until smooth taste and adjust seasoning serve with extra coconut milk and a few more pinch of cayenne,2
i made this soup and is absolutely delicious i cannot eat nothing too hot so i take the curry off and it taste fantastic this soup it gonna be one of my favorite thanks for your healthy simple and delicious recipe,0
curious a to what you use for red curry paste i’ve only used curry paste made with shrimp i thought vegan did not eat shrimp,0
pumpkin or butternut squash soup can go a whole bunch of direction i personally love it thai-spiced red curry is one of my favorite thing especially mixed with creamy coconut this time i experimented with lime leaf i used them a i would bay leaf taking them out before i blended the soup together i found that they added a nice brightness although i realize they’re not always easy to find i’ve seen them lately at my specialty market but i wouldn’t necessarily go hunting for them… if you have to look too hard just leave them out it’ll still be great,0
hi charlotte vinegar counteracts spice you have to add it little by little so your food doesn’t come out too vinegar-y… here i might try a little splash of white wine or rice vinegar if it get too tangy add a little more sweetness to balance hope that help i have a way of often over-spicing my soup too 🙂,0
hi kendra i’d try adding extra salt if it’s not too salty already & pepper a little at a time to taste to help balance the sweet if the soup thickens in the fridge overnight stir in some water to think it a little and that’ll help dilute the flavor a bit also be sure to taste again tomorrow – i find that flavor develop after the soup sits which may tame the sweetness andor if it’s not too coconutty you could stir in more coconut milk if it’s not too spicy you could stir in more curry hope this help,0

amazing i cook many of your recipe and they have all been so delicious but i have to say this might be one of my favorite i used butternut squash a you said you did the first time because sometimes sweet potato can be hard on my stomach and this wa seriously a delicious comfort food my husband and i loved it and we couldn’t wait for leftover for the next two day i doubled the recipe i have many dietary concern so i also used the brown rice pasta and brown rice panko yum,0

in a medium bowl whisk together the pumpkin coconut milk almond milk maple syrup egg cinnamon nutmeg and salt place the cubed bread in a larger bowl and pour the mixture over the bread piece stir gently just until it all get coated scoop the mix into a greased baking dish or individual ramekin if you are using fresh bread you don’t need to let it sit you can pop it right into the oven if you’re using bread that’s a little bit stale let it sit in the fridge for 30 minute or a few hour bake at 350 degree fahrenheit for 25-30 minute or until the top becomes golden brown and the inside start to set but is still gooey the individual ramekin need le baking time than a larger baking dish serve with topping of your choice,2
a few day ago my mom and i were out shopping for dinner again a we stood in the bakery section at whole food snacking on bread sample we kept reaching for more and more piece of this sweet potato bread we didn’t buy any… it’s the sort of thing that’s best eaten in the store because it’s far too dangerous to have around the house,0
however that night i went to bed and had a dream about making this dessert with that bread… along with pumpkin puree and coconut milk that i had leftover in my fridge now i realize not everyone will have access to this specific kind of bread but regular challah bread will work just fine too this sweet potato bread wa similar just subtly more rich and sweet the real star here wa the creamy maple-pumpkin batter i wa also going to add some pecan for crunch but i forgot,0

preheat oven to 350 degree fahrenheit roast the beet by drizzling them with a bit of olive oil some salt and pepper and wrapping them in foil depending on the size and freshness of your beet they should take from 40 minute to 1 hour to roast in the oven check occasionally when they are fork-tender they are done set them aside to cool a soon a they’re cool enough to touch run them under the faucet and slide off the skin with your hand chop into roughly ½ inch cube and set them aside to cool completely to save time i suggest doing this up to one day ahead of time and popping them in the fridge until you’re ready to assemble the salad assemble all salad ingredient on a platter drizzle with a liberal amount of walnut oil a bit of balsamic vinegar a little honey and some salt and pepper,2

½ cup cubed sweet potato cut them pretty small for these toast about 1cm whole grain bread slice i like the purple wheat thats been at my whole food lately olive oil salt & pepper ½ clove of garlic ½ cup crumbled feta ¼ cup dried cranberry 2-3 sage leaf finely diced honey micro sprout for garnish optional red pepper flake optional,1
roast the sweet potato drizzle the cube with olive oil salt and pepper cook in 400 degree oven for 15-20 minute or until golden brown watch it a little closely if you chop these small theyll cook faster than you might think drizzle the bread slice with a bit of oil and toast them in the oven with the potato about 5-10 minute depending on your bread when theyre done take the ½ garlic clove and rub the open side of the garlic on the toast assemble the toast with sweet potato feta cranberry and chopped sage top them with a generous drizzle of honey and some more olive oil if you wish if you like add a few micro sprout and little pinch of red pepper flake and serve,2
i think more of a flatbread might work better than a pizza… grillingbaking the pizza dough first adding a good drizzle of oil and then adding the topping so they’re more bold and fresh the cranberry really add a pop of sweetness that really round out this combo for me,0

2 7 oz package miracle shirataki noodle or kelp soba or noodle of your choice ½ -1 cup sliced shiitake mushroom cleaned gently with a towel 1 cup thinly chopped kale about ½ bunch 1-2 teaspoon minced ginger 1 garlic clove minced 2-3 scallion white and green part chopped 2-3 cup low sodium vegetable broth ½ cup edamame shelled and thawed 1 – 2 tablespoon soy sauce or tamari handful chopped basil handful chopped mint squeeze lime juice drizzle toasted sesame oil sesame seed for garnish extra-virgin olive oil crushed red pepper flake or a splash of sriracha optional salmon optional,1
prepare your noodle – if you’re using the shiratake noodle they don’t need to be cooked but drain and rinse them they have sort of a funky smell so i recommend shocking them in boiling water for 30 second then drain and rinse again in cold water set aside until you’re ready to use them in a large skillet i used a stainless one where the side of it are 4 or so inch high splash a bit of olive oil when it’s hot add the mushroom and a pinch of salt cook stirring occasionally until they have wilted down 5 or so minute toss in the kale ginger garlic and scallion sauté for a few minute until the kale start to wilt down but the garlic is not burning turn the heat down if garlic and ginger are starting to burn add the broth edamame and noodle and simmer for a few minute if your veggie are soaking up all your broth add more turn off the heat and stir in the soy sauce basil mint lime juice and red pepper flake if using taste and adjust seasoning ladle in to bowl and finish with a drizzle of toasted sesame oil and a sprinkle of sesame seed top with cooked salmon if using to cook the salmon season the fish with salt pepper and olive oil and press some sesame seed on top in a hot skillet place the salmon sesame seed side down and sear so a light crust form – 2 or so minute some sesame seed will fall off that’s ok flip the salmon and continue cooking until it’s more but not completely opaque in the middle about 4-6 more minute serve on top of bowl of ginger noodle sprinkle with more sesame seed if some have fallen off,2

hi sarah i’m so glad you enjoyed these,0
somehow we ended up with a lot of photo for this one… so with that i’m going to keep the word short our countdown continues… just 2 day until our trip and many many errand left to go thanks to everyone who left such thoughtful comment and suggestion the other day it’s been such a huge help,0
look great if you want vegan though remember to double check the wonton wrapper a most have egg in them,0
i took some liberty here… sara make an aromatic lemongrass broth to serve these in… i took a lazy shortcut but added some extra ingredient to the filling itself she us sour cream to bind the filling together to make mine a non-dairy version i used miso and tahini instead i blended tasted and decided some garlic and ginger would be nice and then i couldn’t help but squeeze just a bit of lemon juice in,0
these look delicious love the idea of an asian ravioli can’t wait to see sara’s cookbook too have an amazing time on your trip – looking forward to hearing all about it xo sonja,0

1 individual-sized container plain yogurt about ½ cup ½ garlic clove minced ½ lemon zest and juice splash agave pinch paprika mint small handful chopped cilantro small handful chopped sea salt and fresh black pepper 2 red bell pepper halved seed and ribbing removed ¾ cup israeli couscous pre-cooked or quinoa or other grain 3 scallion white and green part sliced ½ teaspoon ground sweet paprika ½ garlic clove minced ½ lemon zest and juice 2 big handful baby green i had baby kale mint small handful chopped cilantro handful chopped ¼ cup pine nut toasted chopped ¼ cup dried currant extra-virgin olive oil pinch red pepper flake sea salt and fresh black pepper,1
preheat the oven to 350 degree make the yogurt sauce in a small bowl combine the yogurt garlic lemon zest and juice agave paprika mint cilantro and pinch of salt and pepper taste and adjust seasoning and chill in the refrigerator until ready to serve place the pepper cut side open on a baking sheet drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with salt bake for 15 minute or until they begin to soften cook the couscous in a pot of salted boiling water until al dente about 8-10 minute when it’s finished drain and set aside toss it in a bit of olive oil so the little pearl don’t stick together in a large skillet over medium heat pour a few splash of olive oil and toss in the scallion paprika garlic and pinch of salt and pepper stir a bit then add the lemon zest and green stir some more to let the green wilt down a bit add a big squeeze of lemon juice and stir in the herb toasted pine nut currant and red pepper flake add the couscous mix together until the herb and green are just wilted and everything is combined taste and adjust seasoning if it’s a bit too bold and spicy at this point that’s ok – once you bake it with the sweet pepper the flavor will dial down fill the pepper if all of the filling doesn’t fit it’s ok just set the remainder aside and scoop it on top at the end bake uncovered for about 10 -12 minute alternatively if you like your pepper much softer cover them with foil and bake longer i prefer my cooked pepper to still have a little bite i pre-baked the pepper so the herb in the filling wouldn’t burn – i find unless you cover your stuffed pepper with a layer of cheese grain filling become a bit dry if cooked the entire way with the pepper remove pepper from oven spoon on any of the remaining couscous mixture top with the yogurt sauce and any extra herb the sauce is also delicious on some whole grain toasted baguette which i served with our meal,2

1 avocado ¼ cup hemp seed 1 lime zest and juice 1 small zucchini about ½ cup or so ½ tablespoon miso more to taste 1 scallion white and green part chopped 1 tablespoon minced ginger ¼ teaspoon ground cumin ¼ teaspoon ground cayenne 2 medium zucchini spiralized or peeled into long strip ½ cup chopped mango ½ cup edamame shelled and blanched ¼ cup toasted sliced almond lime wedge to serve sea salt,1
make the avocado miso sauce in a blender combine the avocado hemp seed lime zest and juice zucchini miso scallion ginger cumin and cayenne and blend until smooth taste and adjust seasoning toss the zucchini noodle with a much or little sauce a you like taste and adjust seasoning the sauce will become more diluted a you toss it with the noodle so you’ll likely have to add some salt and pepper top the noodle with the mango edamame and almond and serve immediately with lime wedge and extra sauce on the side this recipe made a good amount of extra sauce i also had a pretty large avocado and because avocado brown quickly it only lasted an extra day in the fridge i used my leftover sauce on a kale salad the following afternoon,2
because they’re on the lighter side i prefer them with a with a really saucy sauce they’d be great with a chunky tomato sauce or a light cream sauce but i went for this cooling avocado miso sauce i added ginger cumin and cayenne to add a flavor punch,0

we don’t really like carrot ok i take that back we like cake made out of carrot and we like raw carrot but both jack and i grew up with a disdain for cooked carrot of course we only knew them a the mushy baby carrot version or worse yet the mushy baby carrot in the pot roast version we both have memory of our mom smasing the carrot and boiled potato together and pouring gravy on top “but it’s so good this way” my mom would say… each and every time… a if one day this mush would miraculously taste like ice cream,0

make the dressing whisk together the walnut oil olive oil lemon juice and zest garlic honey and pinch of salt and pepper set aside to a large bowl add the arugula and garlic followed by your cooked warm quinoa toss until incorporated the arugula will wilt slightly which is what you want if you’re using salad green i would wait to add them until the end i like arugula slightly wilted salad green not raw slightly-wilted kale would also be good here add the chickpea radish sun dried tomato walnut chive basil and cheese to the bowl and pour the dressing on top toss and taste add more salt and pepper if necessary i finished this with another drizzle of walnut oil and some shaved parmesan over individual bowl,2

preheat the oven to 350 set the raspberry aside especially if they’re frozen to thaw at room temperature while you assemble everything else make a make-shift double boiler by placing a glass bowl over a saucepan with simmering water make sure the bottom of the bowl doesn’t actually touch the water melt the butter and chocolate stirring so the chocolate doesn’t burn on the bottom when the chocolate is melted remove from heat stir in the milk let the mixture cool to almost room temperature before adding the egg unless you’re not adding the egg then proceed in a separate bowl mix together the flour baking powder and salt set aside into the chocolate bowl stir in the maple syrup and vanilla stir in already beaten egg then add in the dry mixture stirring until just combined make the raspberry cheese swirl whisk strongly by hand or with a mixer together the ingredient for the cheese layer – cream cheese goat cheese butter maple syrup and vanilla - until smooth a i mentioned above i stirred this up without the goat cheese divided it in half and only added goat cheese to one half into an 8×8 greased pan or 2 smaller pan – i used two 5×7 pan pour the brownie batter spoon the cheese mixture on top doesn’t have to be an even layer gently crush the raspberry with your hand and add them with juice on top of the cheese layer take a knife and swirl the layer in the pan bake for 25-30 minute depending on the size of your pan and thickness of your brownie,2

preheat the oven to 450 degree chop the cauliflower and pulse floret in a food processor be careful not to puree it or grind it until it’s mushy you’re going for a “riced” fluffy consistency it should not be sticking together at this point whisk the 3 egg and mix with the cauliflower almond flour onion powder garlic powder nutritional yeast if using and pinch of salt and pepper form the dough into a ball it should be pretty wet but if it’s too sticky to handle add more flour gently knead it a few time adding some flour on top if necessary to help it come together note – this will not resemble regular pizza dough – it won’t be a easy or pliable to work with – that’s ok press “dough” ball down onto a pizza stone or baking sheet lined with parchment paper gently mold into a circle dusting a bit more flour if it make it easier for you to work with i wa able to lift mine up and flip it over a few time to get it to spread if yours stick and you can’t lift it off the pan it’s still ok try to spread it to be a little le than ¼-inch thick crust need to be baked for 25-30 minute total since i wa topping mine with pesto i baked the crust by itself entirely and added the topping at the end i sautéed the broccoli and roasted the tomato separately from the crust if you’re making a pizza with cheese or tomato sauce bake crust for about 15 minute then top with sauce and other topping and bake for 10-15 minute more oven time may vary depending on your oven or consistency of your “dough”,2

preheat the oven to 450 degree make sure your cauliflower is dry before you start the wetter it is the harder it will be to work with chop the cauliflower and pulse floret in a food processor be careful not to puree it or grind it until it’s mushy you’re going for a “riced” fluffy consistency it should not be sticking together at this point whisk the 3 egg and mix with the cauliflower almond flour onion powder garlic powder and nutritional yeast if using and pinch of salt and pepper form dough into a ball it should be pretty wet but if it’s too sticky to handle add more flour gently “knead” it a few time adding some flour on top if necessary to help it come together note – this will not resemble regular pizza dough – it won’t be a easy or pliable to work with – that’s ok just do the best you can press “dough” ball down onto a pizza stone or baking sheet lined with parchment paper gently mold into a circle dusting a bit more flour if it make it easier for you to work with i wa able to lift mine up and flip it over a few time to get it to spread if yours stick and you can’t lift it off the pan it’s still ok – once the egg bake thing will bind together even if the dough itself is a little messy try to spread it about ¼ inch thick brush the top with a little garlic oil or plain olive oil before putting in the oven bake crust by itself for 15 minute add mozzarella on top and bake for an additional 10 or so minute until the cheese start to bubble carefully crack egg directly on top of the pizza so they dont slide off and broil for 2 more minute or until the egg is sufficiently cooked oven time may vary remove from the oven and add spoonful of pesto roasted tomato basil and red pepper flake,2
nope start with raw cauliflower no steaming necessary,0

not that this recipe ha anything to do with deep-dish pizza – there’s no butter crust no sausage no brick of cheese this “pizza” made out of ground cauliflower and almond is healthy light and gluten-free i couldn’t wait to give this a try but i had no clue what to expect – whether it would fall apart… taste like mush…,0
i’ve been meaning to try a cauliflower pizza crust — and your “pizza” look so appetizing yum i love the addition of egg on pizza,0

my favorite thing about cooking is when thing come out of nothing after the holiday we had an empty fridge empty countertops… content of a meal or even a snack nowhere in sight i had a pear that wa on the verge of way-too-ripe half an onion… and then i noticed a sweet potato that i never remembered buying i’ve seen recipe for butternut squash soup with pear so i figured this would work just a well i foraged through the back of the fridge and pantry for the rest of the ingredient then i remembered i had this delicious coconutlemon zestyogurt cream leftover from the night before that would become the perfect garnish to balance the bold indian flavor in the soup,0

i made this soup today a i had an acorn squash that had to be cooked i used it instead of the sweet potato i also used ground coriander in lieu of the garam masal i like the flexibility of this lovely autumn soup and the fact that it’s child-friendly my four year old liked it especially with the lemon cream,0
how funny i just made a sweet potato apple and sage soup i love the use of the coconut milk brilliant 🙂,0
